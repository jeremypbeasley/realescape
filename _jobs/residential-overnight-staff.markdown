ROLE SUMMARY  The Residential Overnight Staff is one of the primary support roles in the REST restorative housing program, which is designed to serve up to six women, age 18-30, who are escaping sexual exploitation or trafficking for commercial sex.

This is an overnight position, (Sun-Fri), which allows for sleep in a private staff room and bathroom. The primary goal of this position is to be a consistent presence in the home after hours, nurturing relationships with the residents in a way that helps them stay engaged and committed to the program as they pursue healing and work toward reaching their self-identified goals. The emphasis of the overnight position is on maintaining safety and stability in the home.  This position reports to the Residential Program Supervisor and works closely with the Wraparound Case Manager as part of a team.
