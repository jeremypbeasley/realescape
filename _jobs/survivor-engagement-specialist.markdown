REST is hiring a part-time Survivor Engagement Specialist who will provide support and guidance to survivors who receive services at our drop-in center, emergency shelter and/or residential program.  This will be done through sharing personal experience of recovery and helping survivors stay engaged in REST programs as they work toward accomplishing their self-identified goals. This team member will be supervised by the Community Advocate Supervisor, but serve across multiple teams. The Survivor Engagement Specialist should have a team-centered focus with the understanding that this role is part of a larger team and may also be engaging with partners, volunteers, and community members to help each client build meaningful community support.  All staff and volunteer roles within REST should enhance each clientâ€™s experience and allow maximum opportunity for trusting relationships to build with survivors participating in the programs.
