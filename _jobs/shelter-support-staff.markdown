The REST Emergency Receiving Center (ERC) is a new program at REST and is a critical need for women in the community who are trying to exit the sex trade and reach their personal goals. The plan for the Emergency Receiving Center is to provide drop-in services and 24/7 access to crisis intervention support, with an option for short-term emergency shelter for up to seven women (30-60 days). Women who are accepted to stay at the ERC receive stabilizing support like crisis intervention, case management, referrals for chemical dependency and mental health services, survivor support groups, education, and life skills assistance. 

The ERC Shelter Support Staff are often the first point of contact clients make when accessing shelter services with REST, and play a critical role in ensuring services are running smoothly. Central to this position is the ability to develop trusting relationships while maintaining policies and procedures to ensure safe and effective programming. The Shelter Support Staff work with a team to assist guests in accessing services, meeting their needs and living harmoniously in short-term community.
