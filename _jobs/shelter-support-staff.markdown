Real Escape from the Sex Trade (REST) is now hiring for Shelter Support Staff to join our emergency shelter team. Our mission is to provide pathways to freedom, safety, and hope for victims of sex trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation. REST is a Christian organization dedicated to serving people of all faiths and backgrounds.

The Emergency Receiving Center (ERC) is a critical need for women in the community who are trying to exit the sex trade and reach their personal goals. The plan for the Emergency Receiving Center is to provide drop-in services and 24/7 access to crisis intervention support, with an option for short-term emergency shelter for up to seven women (30â€“60 days). Women who visit the ERC will be able to receive stabilizing support like crisis intervention, case management, referrals for chemical dependency and mental health services, survivor support groups, education and life skills assistance. Guests of the ERC may be women who are actively or recently involved in the sex trade, and/or experiencing chemical dependency and mental health-related needs. 

The REST Emergency Receiving Center is a women-only environment. Therefore, only female applicants will be considered for this position.
