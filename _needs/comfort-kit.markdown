This comfort kit is provided to girls who are recovered by the police or otherwise leave the sex trade. The kit includes appropriate and comfortable clothing, food and hygiene items which many girls have not had access to. Our hope is to provide for the girls º felt needs and communicate that someone sees and care for them. The cost of each kit is approximately $25.

All items should be new and nonperishable. Please place items into a non-paper reusable bag. Please pray for the girl who will receive this bag. Do not include items beyond this list.
