Comfort Kits:
This comfort kit is provided to victims who are recovered by the police or otherwise leave the sex trade. The kit includes appropriate and comfortable clothing, food and hygiene items which many of our clients have not had access to. Our hope is to provide for physical needs and communicate that someone sees and care for them. The cost of each kit is approximately $25.

All items should be new and nonperishable. Please place items into a non-paper reusable bag. Please pray for the individual who will receive this bag. Do not include items beyond this list.
