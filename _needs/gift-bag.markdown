This gift bag is given to people who are actively in the life. This gift along with the message of our outreach team is that Jesus loves them, offers them love, grace, hope and a new life. This tangible gift opens doors for conversations where we can learn about other needs they might have. We also provide hygiene items that they typically donʼt have access to through their pimps so they can properly care for themselves. The cost of the gift bag is approximately $7.

Place items in a small clear sized bag with a twist tie. Do not include items beyond on this list. Please pray for the individual who will receive this bag.
* 1 Lipgloss
* 1 Nail polish
* 1 Eyeshadow
* 1 Lotion (mini-sized)
* 2 Feminine wipes (brands like Vagisil)
* Optional: mini deodorant, small tissue pack, travel-sized shampoo/conditioner or body wash
