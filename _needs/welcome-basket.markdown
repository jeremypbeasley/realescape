Moving into a new home for any of us can be a stressful, but it is especially hard for women coming out of the sex trade. The women are joining a new environment, with a new community and it is likely to be a home like theyâ€™ve never experienced before. Help us welcome her home and minimize the stress by creating a gift basket to commemorate her new life. The cost of a welcome basket is around $100.00.

All items should be new and nonperishable. Please place items in a decorative basket. Do not include items beyond this list. Please pray for the girl who will receive this welcome basket.
