  small team of women with experience dealing with troubled youth and sexual abuse
  issues, and other members of the team with backgrounds in wraparound services and
  case management to develop relationships with people being commercially sexually
  exploited (trafficked), or otherwise engaged in the sex trade or are at risk to
  enter.

section3_headline: Our Values
section3_body: Our values are our attempt to articulate our identity, and to define
  the manner in which we approach our work. Our values are about how we view all people,
  in particular, our clients, and our motivation for why we do what we do.
section3a_title: One:One Over Many
section3a_body: There are many ways to join anti-human trafficking efforts, such as
  through awareness, education, legislation, etc. Though these efforts are necessary
  and vital, today, people are suffering the consequences of sexual exploitation and
  addiction who need hope for real and lasting change. Therefore, we bring care to
  the individual through direct one-to-one contact.
section3b_title: Arduous Over Effortless
section3b_body: Due to the nature of our approach, we know this is a long- suffering
  and painful work. We know not all people are called to this approach, but we are
  certain this is our purpose. We meet clients where they are and walk with them to
  the end. Relationships are hard work, but the highlights of joy throughout outweigh
  the suffering found within.
section3c_title: People Over Cause
section3c_body: We do not fight for a cause or an ideology. Though we have an ideology
  and are a part of a cause, it’s not why we’re here. We exist to serve suffering
  people who experience complex emotions. They are people of great value.
section3d_title: Persons Over People
section3d_body: In a more nuanced sense, we serve individuals. We get to know them
  by name and spend time with each one. We learn about their hopes and dreams. This
  is not a factory and they are not products on an assembly line. We care for each
  one according to their individualized need.
section3e_title: Helpers Over Heroes
section3e_body: The narrative surrounding the sex trade is often one of villains and
  heroes. The heroes are rescuers, and the villains are the traffickers and johns.
  We’ve learned it’s not that black and white. We are not rescuers. We are not better
  or more valuable than those we serve.
section3f_title: Holistic Over Piecemeal
section3f_body: We’re in this till the end. As far as they are willing to walk, we
  will be with them. We don’t just want clients physically out of the sex trade; we
  want them to be whole, free from fears and filled with hope and dreams.
section3g_title: Women & Men
section3g_body: We serve both men and women. Those enslaved in the sex trade include
  those being exploited for sex, those soliciting commercial sex, and those profiting
  off the commercial exploitation of others. Like us, they are not all without fault,
  and some are more guilty than others, but they all need redemption.
section3h_title: For Our Joy & His Glory
section3h_body: Our chief end is His glory and the joy of those serving and those
  being served.
