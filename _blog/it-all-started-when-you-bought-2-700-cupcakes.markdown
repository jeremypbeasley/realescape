It all started when you bought $2,700 cupcakes.

Well, actually, it started when you and hundreds like you came to [A Night of REST](http://iwantrest.com/event/a-night-of-rest) with generous grit to give freedom, safety and hope to sexually exploited people in our community. One of my table mates remarked that it seemed if we had enough cupcakes, together, we could bring peace on earth.
