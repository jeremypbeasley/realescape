![A Familiar Story: R. Kelly's Alleged Victims](/uploads/REST_Blog_A-familiar-story-r-kelly-800.jpg)

“They said six women live in properties rented by Kelly in Chicago and the Atlanta suburbs, and he controls every aspect of their lives: dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records.”

That quote is from journalist Jim DeRogatis’s 2017 exposé *[Inside the Pied Piper of R&B’s “Cult”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimderogatis/parents-told-police-r-kelly-is-keeping-women-in-a-cult)*.

The article goes on to describe the manipulation, control, and abuse that R&B singer Robert Kelly is accused of by numerous women and their families.

As of February 22, 2019, Kelly stands charged of ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were under the legal age of consent. This indictment comes 25 years after accusations of sexual misconduct against Kelly began when the 27-year-old Kelly married 15-year-old Aaliyah in a secret wedding with falsified documents. 

In those 25 years, several young women have come forward with shockingly similar stories: Kelly met them when they were teenagers, offered to help them with their music career, made grandiose promises, began to isolate them from their families, imposed strict and controlling rules, and demanded they perform sex acts with him (in many instances on videotape), and abused them when they didn’t comply. Many of the accounts also talk about an older woman, who is one of Kelly’s insiders, who trained the younger girls on Kelly’s sexual preferences. 

Now consider the stories we hear from some of the sex trafficking victims and survivors we serve about the recruitment and grooming process they experienced:

## Young Girls and Boys
In King County, WA it is estimated that there are over 500 children and youth being exploited in the sex trade annually. According to the US Department of Justice, the median age of entry into sex trafficking in the United States is 13–14. The vast majority of these children have been sexually abused, likely come from an unstable background, and are approached by an older man or woman, promising them a better life. One in three runaway teens will be approached by a trafficker within 48 hours of leaving home. 

## The Promise
The grooming process often begins with affection, attention, and learning and then exploiting someone’s dreams. For many young girls and boys, it can be as simple as a promise of love—or as big as a promise of a life of luxury. The abuser or pimp, often known as a “[Boyfriend Pimp](https://iwantrest.com/blog/how-traffickers-exploit-people-for-sex/)”, “Romeo Pimp” or a “Finesse Pimp” in this case, might shower their victim with gifts and extravagant experiences to gain their trust and convince their young victims that they love them—and that no one else does. 

## The Isolation
Once trust is built, the abuser begins the process of isolation. This often entails taking steps to cut the victim off from their family and friends, such as monitoring their phone calls. The victims are taught to mistrust their family and authority, and that their abuser is the only one who really cares about them. In many of the stories we hear at REST, threats of violence against both the victim and their family are common manipulation tactics to keep them isolated and separated from their family and friends. 

## The Switch
Eventually, the once loving and exciting new relationship takes a turn—and what was once a consensual relationship turns exploitative. This is often the “turn out” point, where the boyfriend pimp uses manipulation to get his victim to sell their body to a friend or a stranger for the first time. We also see this in the pornography industry, where the victim is videotaped without consent, or the video is distributed without consent. This is the moment the dream turns into a nightmare. 

## The Control
One key element in trafficking situations is the control maintained by a pimp or abuser. Manipulation tactics utilized include isolation, emotional, mental, and physical abuse. The stories we hear at REST include a wide variety of control tactics such as threats against family and friends, physical abuse, taking control of personal documents like birth certificates and passports, financial control and much more. When that control is momentarily lost, and a victim is considered “out of pocket” (or disobeying rules), control is often regained and enforced through physical violence.

## The Trauma Bond
Trauma bonding is a common outcome when a victim is put through ongoing cycles of abuse and reward—like being beaten for breaking rules, then being showered with affection. Trauma bonds are powerful and are a huge barrier for victims to escape their abusers. Even once someone has escaped, there may still be strong feelings of love for the abuser and the temptation to return. This is one of the reasons why leaving a trafficking situation can be so difficult—and may take many attempts to do for good. 

There are no trafficking-related charges against R. Kelly. But consider, as you read and hear the stories from R. Kelly’s alleged victims whether parts of their stories sound familiar. Do you hear elements from the process we described above—the promise, the isolation, the switch, the control, or the trauma bond?  

It can years, perhaps even decades, for someone who was promised a better life and then sexually exploited to be free not just physically, but from the trauma bond with their abuser. At REST, we believe that every single person deserves to be loved, and deserves a life free from exploitation. Healing from the long-lasting effects of extreme and complex trauma and abuse is an ongoing journey—but with love, unconditional care, and trauma-informed support, we know it’s possible—as we’ve seen it time and time again.
