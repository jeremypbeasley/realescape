We are glad to talk to journalists, news organizations, bloggers, podcasters, and the like about the issue of sex trafficking. We aim to inform and educate, while inviting help to fight commercial sexual exploitation in our community, in our state, nationwide, and globally. 

We will provide information about the sex trade, what we’re doing to help exploited individuals find pathways of freedom, safety, and hope, and will gladly set up interviews with pertinent staff members. We do not provide interviews with survivors — as we want to respect our clients’ privacy, avoid re-exploiting them for their stories, and hope media organizations agree with us that survivors are more than the chapter of their life that involved commercial sexual exploitation. 

You can submit your media request to [communication@iwantrest.com](mailto:communication@iwantrest.com).
