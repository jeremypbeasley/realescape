### Citizens
Citizens is a rock group based out of Seattle, Washington that seeks to blend energetic music with honest storytelling about what the members are experiencing, learning and believing.

“You can share as much as you want about the Gospel on Biblical terms, but the true power of the Gospel comes from you telling your story,” singer Zach Bolen says.

Comprised of Bolen, Spencer Abbott, Nathan Furtado, Adam Skatula and Brian Eichelberger, Citizens had humble beginnings as a worship band and found a large platform with the name Citizens and Saints. Armed with authentic lyricism and powerful performances, the family that is Citizens is ready to expand its reach and sound as it melds its brand with the hip-hop artists on Humble Beast.

### Ghost Ship
Ghost Ship is a deeply-rooted Americana folk band with a church-centered focus. With influences from Savannah to Stillwater, to the band’s birthplace of Seattle in 2008, Ghost Ship’s sound has maintained its southern charm while incorporating aspects of pop influences. Their well-received debut album The Good King, along with EPs A River With No End and Ghost Ship Live, were released through Mars Hill Music. Now on Gospel Song Records, the band has released an EP, Costly, and a full-length of the same name. While recording Costly, Ghost Ship helped plant a new church in Seattle's University District called Cross & Crown. They continue to do what they've always felt called to do: lead worship and write music that points to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

### Handsome & Gretyl
He came from Toronto; she, from Seattle.
Both had music in their blood, instruments in their hands, and a mind to create.
The mountains led him to the west; a star led her to the north. 
In Vancouver they met and schooled—studying music and life.
They found promise.
They found love. 

In less than a year they put school on hold, got married, and lived.
With music and purpose guiding them, school called again and to Nashville they went. 
He became an audio engineer; she became a songwriter; music stayed central and they continued to create.

The couple formed Handsome and Gretyl and released their debut EP, Hold On Tight Love in 2011, followed by a Christmas EP, Wonder in 2012 and their first full-length, Miles and Miles in 2013. Throughout 2015 they worked on a new project called TWELVE, where each song was written, recorded, and released each month. Fans were able to follow along via Pledge Music until the official release on December 12, 2015.

Handsome and Gretyl have created an earthy folk feel crossed with an imaginative jaunt of pop, a sweet and tangy piece of wild berry pie. This duo draws from real life, delivering optimistic though realistic lyrics, seasoned with the chill of snow, the sea breeze, and the hope of tomorrow’s sunrise.
