We are blown away by the generosity of this year’s A Night of REST 600+ attendees. Thank you, to each and every person, who came out in support of the work that REST does. 

Together you raised over $532,000 to offer pathways of freedom, safety, and hope to individuals who have experienced commercial sexual exploitation—through your generosity, you declared that survivors deserve to be loved. 

See a full recap of the event on our blog [here](https://iwantrest.com/blog/i-am-loved-a-night-of-rest-2017/), and check out some photos from the event below!
