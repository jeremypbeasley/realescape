Each year, REST creates a space where others are invited into our story—an opportunity to use our collective influence to make a difference in our community.

We know that REST is moving the needle in the fight against sex trafficking, as an increasing number of women experience recovery and restoration with our help. But, on any given night in King County there are still hundreds of individuals being sold for sex and it is critical that we press on. 
 
This year, we’re hosting our 5th annual A Night of REST to raise funds that will help trafficking victims find a path to freedom, safety, and hope. This is an opportunity to make a significant difference in the lives of girls and women that need to know there is a way out of the sex trade. It’s a night where we come together and remember that we are part of something bigger. Join us in our goal of raising $400,000 to bring REST to exploited individuals in our community.
