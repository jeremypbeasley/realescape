Join us for [Seattle Foundation’s](https://www.seattlefoundation.org/) annual day of community giving on Wednesday, May 9! 

Whether you can give $10 or $10,000, your gift will make an impact for those in our community who are experiencing or have experienced, commercial sexual exploitation. 

In addition to inviting you to give on May 9, we’re inviting you to a virtual tour of our Emergency Receiving Center’s Drop-In Center, followed by a Q & A session. The live broadcast will begin at 9:30 a.m.

If you have a question about the local sex trade and how REST is responding to it, ask it in the comments on our [Facebook event page](http://bit.ly/2HtAKjn). 

RSVP to our [Facebook event](http://bit.ly/2HtAKjn) so you get a reminder to tune in and give.
