Don’t miss our annual poker tournament and happy hour on Thursday, March 8! Go “all-in” for REST, enjoy libations and eats, and try your luck at becoming the next Raise ‘em for REST Poker Champion. When you chip in, you’ll support REST and help bring pathways to freedom, safety, and hope to individuals exploited in the sex trade in our community. 
 
We’ll open the doors at 5:30 p.m. for happy hour and poker lessons (if you need them), and start the tournament at 6:30 p.m. sharp.

Individual tickets are available for $75, or rally a Texas Hold’em Table (9 seats) for $675.

Must be 21 to attend. 

Online registration is now closed, but there will be some tickets at the door. 

RSVP to our [Facebook event](http://bit.ly/RaiseEmForREST18) for event updates and info.

Street parking is available on all blocks near the venue. There are also six paid parking lots on Western Ave within two blocks of Tune Kitchen.
