Go all-in at our annual Raise ‘Em for REST poker tournament! Every time you “chip in,” you’ll create pathways to freedom, safety, and hope to victims and survivors of sex trafficking in our community. Rally your friends and co-workers to join us for an evening of hors d'oeuvres, local beverages, and a lively poker tournament—all experience levels are welcome! Join us after work and “chip in” to raise critical support for victims and survivors of sexual exploitation. 
 
We’ll open the doors at 5:30 p.m. for happy hour and poker lessons (if you need them), and start the tournament at 6:15 p.m. sharp.

Individual tickets are available for $75, or rally a Texas Hold’em Table (9 seats) for $675.

Must be 21 to attend.
