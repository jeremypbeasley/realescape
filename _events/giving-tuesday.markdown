There’s Black Friday, Cyber Monday—and Giving Tuesday! #GivingTuesday is a global day of giving where people come together to celebrate the generous spirit of the season by supporting organizations that they care about. 

We would love if you joined us to help provide pathways of freedom, safety, and hope to women and men who have experienced sexual exploitation in our community. 

Every donation this holiday season helps declare, “You deserve to be loved.” to local victims and survivors of sex trafficking.
