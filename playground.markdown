headline: A holistic, end-to-end approach against the sex trade.
section1_body: "REST serves individuals who have been trafficked in or have experience
  working in the sex trade. We provide a wide variety of support as they seek to exit
  the sex trade and reach their personal goals. REST is a Christian organization,
  but is dedicated to serving people of all backgrounds, regardless of faith, and
  we don’t require participation in any faith activities in order to receive assistance.
  We believe everyone is worthy of love. Therefore, through all of REST services,
  we simply want to communicate, \n### ***“You deserve to have the life you want.
  You deserve to be loved.”*****"
section2_headline: Emergency Receiving Center
section2a_title: '24/7 Hotline: 206-451-REST'
section2a_body: 'The hotline is available for calls or texts 24 hours a day, 7 days
  a week. Skilled advocates respond to calls or texts from individuals who are in
  need of assistance or service providers who would like to make a referral. Through
  the hotline, we can provide information and referrals to help survivors connect
  to the services they need, screen for intake into the emergency shelter, and start
  the process for screening into the REST House.  '
section2b_title: Shelter
section2b_body: Direct outreach teams build relationships with girls and women actively
  in the sex trade. Teams are out on the streets both in mornings and afternoons.
  The goal is to be a consistent presence that offers help and hope. We want to dream
  with them of a life free from sexual exploitation and help them take next steps
  toward counseling, sobriety, education, or housing.
section2c_title: Drop-In Center
section2c_body: The Drop-In Center is open Monday - Thursday from 2pm-8pm and provides
  a safe space to rest, connect with other survivors, build a community of support,
  participate in classes, support groups and workshops, and enjoy a meal. The drop-in
  center provides opportunities for survivors to get assistance in accessing resources
  like housing, employment, education, healthcare, transportation, mental health services,
  and chemical dependency services.
section3_headline: More REST Services
section3a_title: Community Advocacy
section3a_body: 'The Community Advocacy program provides assistance to people currently
  in or exiting the sex trade throughout all of King County. Advocates meet with survivors
  to identify their needs, help them access services, reach their goals, and develop
  a supportive community as they seek to build a life without exploitation. This program
  also includes direct outreach to potential victims of trafficking through text messages
  to phone numbers pulled from escort ads. '
section3b_title: The REST House
section3b_body: 'The REST House is a staffed, transitional living program for up to
  six young women, ages 18–30, who are exiting the sex trade and want to pursue a
  new life. It is an individualized program that provides the warmth of a home and
  the time needed to prepare for greater independence. Residents can stay for a year,
  and receive supportive services while pursuing their life goals that are most important
  to them. '
section3c_title: Prevention
section3c_body: The Prevention Team connects with youth in juvenile detention centers,
  and on diversion. These girls and boys are highly at-risk, though many of them have
  already been sexually exploited or have begun the process of exploiting. This team
  teaches trafficking and gender-based violence prevention workshops, and provides
  one on one mentorship and chaplaincy for those interested.
