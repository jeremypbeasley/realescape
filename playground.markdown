section1_body: "REST serves individuals of all ages and genders who have been trafficked
  in or involved in the sex trade. We seek to care for the whole person: mind, body,
  and spirit, and value the unique strengths and needs of each individual. REST services
  are relationship-based, individualized, and trauma-informed. REST is a Christian
  organization, but is dedicated to serving people of all backgrounds, regardless
  of faith, and we don’t require participation in any faith activities in order to
  receive assistance. We believe everyone is worthy of love. Therefore, through all
  REST services, we simply want to communicate: \n\n> ### **“You deserve to have the
  life you want. You deserve to be loved.\"**\n\n<!-- BEGIN: Constant Contact Email

section3a_title: Community Advocacy
section3a_body: The Community Advocacy program provides assistance to people involved
  in or exiting the sex trade throughout King County. Advocates provide consistent
  relationships and case management to help individuals of any age or gender identify
  needs, access resources, build a community of support, and reach the goals that
  are most important to them. This program also includes direct outreach to potential
  victims of trafficking through text messages to phone numbers pulled from escort
  ads.
section3b_title: The REST House
section3b_body: The REST House is a staffed, transitional living program for up to
  six young women, ages 18–30, who are exiting the sex trade and want to pursue a
  new life. It is an individualized program that provides the warmth of a home and
  the time needed to prepare for greater independence. Residents can stay up to a
  year, and receive supportive services like trauma counseling and case management
  while pursuing life goals that are most important to them. Call 206-451-REST to
  learn more.
section3c_title: Prevention
section3c_body: The Prevention Team connects with girls and boys in juvenile detention
  centers, and through diversion. These girls and boys are at-risk for entering the
  sex trade, though many of them have already been exposed to it in some form. This
  team facilitates workshops to help the youth gain awareness and build skills to
  advocate for themselves and their peers against trafficking and gender-based violence.
  We also provide one on one mentorship and chaplaincy for any youth who are interested.
