headline: A holistic, end-to-end approach against the sex trade.
section1_body: |-
  REST serves individuals who have been trafficked in or worked in the sex trade. We provide a wide variety of support as they seek to exit the sex trade and reach their goals. REST is a Christian organization, but is dedicated to serving people of all backgrounds, regardless of faith, and we don’t require participation in any faith activities in order to receive assistance. Through all of REST services, we simply want to communicate, “You deserve to have the life you want. You deserve to be loved.”

section2_headline: Women & Girls
section2a_title: Prevention
section2a_body: Prevention teams serve those under 18 who are at-risk for entering
  prostitution. Though many have already been sexually exploited, the goal is to prevent
  further harm and give them access to resources that will contribute to their success.
  We also offer to connect them with a REST mentor, who will model a healthy relationship
  and commit to being a regular part of their life.
section2b_title: Intervention
section2b_body: Direct outreach teams build relationships with girls and women actively
  in the sex trade. Teams are out on the streets both in mornings and afternoons.
  The goal is to be a consistent presence that offers help and hope. We want to dream
  with them of a life free from sexual exploitation and help them take next steps
  toward counseling, sobriety, education, or housing.
section2c_title: Restoration
section2c_body: Rounding out our continuum of care is aftercare. We offer trauma-informed,
  strengths-based case management, mentorship, long-term residential housing (ages
  18-24 single or with children), and soon a 24-hour emergency shelter both of which
  have been specifically designed for those exploited for commercial sex. REST also
  provides mentorship for clients seeking additional support.
section3_headline: Men
section3a_title: Demand
section3a_body: At the root of commercial sexual exploitation lies the lustful and
  broken hearts of men who drive the demand. In order for systemic transformation
  to occur in our culture, the hearts of men have to change. Men have to want something
  different. REST knows that resources and relationships are key to cultivating this
  kind of revival in our community and beyond.
section3b_title: Relationships
section3b_body: Our demand reduction team invites sex buyers seeking change to a supportive
  community where freedom from unwanted sexual behavior can be found. Because much
  of sexual sin and addiction is built and thrives in isolation, transparency and
  accountability are paramount. Our hope is for meaningful and sustained transformation.

section3c_title: Resources
section3c_body: REST is in the process of developing a comprehensive online network
  of resources and relationships for sex buyers and men who are experiencing other
  unwanted sexual behavior. We know many men desire change, but may not know where
  to look for help. We want them to know they are not alone and there is hope for
  change.
