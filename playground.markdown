  working in the sex trade. We provide a wide variety of support as they seek to exit

  but is dedicated to serving people of all backgrounds, regardless of faith, and
  we don’t require participation in any faith activities in order to receive assistance.

  we simply want to communicate, \n**# “You deserve to have the life you want. You
  deserve to be loved.**"
