headline: A holistic, end-to-end approach against the sex trade.
section1_body: "REST serves individuals who have been trafficked in or have experience
  working in the sex trade. We provide a wide variety of support as they seek to exit
  the sex trade and reach their personal goals. REST is a Christian organization,
  but is dedicated to serving people of all backgrounds, regardless of faith, and
  we don’t require participation in any faith activities in order to receive assistance.
  Through all of REST services, we simply want to communicate, \n\n***“You deserve
  to have the life you want. You deserve to be loved.”*****"

section2a_title: 'Emergency Receiving Center: 24/7 Hotline'
section2a_body: 'The hotline is available for calls or texts 24 hours a day, 7 days
  a week. Skilled advocates respond to calls or texts from individuals who are in
  need of assistance or service providers who would like to make a referral. Through
  the hotline, we can provide information and referrals to help survivors connect
  to the services they need, screen for intake into the emergency shelter, and start
  the process for screening into the REST House.  '
section2b_title: 'Emergency Receiving Center: Shelter'
section2b_body: Direct outreach teams build relationships with girls and women actively
  in the sex trade. Teams are out on the streets both in mornings and afternoons.
  The goal is to be a consistent presence that offers help and hope. We want to dream
  with them of a life free from sexual exploitation and help them take next steps
  toward counseling, sobriety, education, or housing.
section2c_title: 'Emergency Receiving Center: Drop-In Center'
section2c_body: The Drop-In Center is open Monday - Thursday from 2pm-8pm and provides
  a safe space to rest, connect with other survivors, build a community of support,
  participate in classes, support groups and workshops, and enjoy a meal. The drop-in
  center provides opportunities for survivors to get assistance in accessing resources
  like housing, employment, education, healthcare, transportation, mental health services,
  and chemical dependency services.
section3_headline: Men
section3a_title: Demand
section3a_body: At the root of commercial sexual exploitation lies the lustful and
  broken hearts of men who drive the demand. In order for systemic transformation
  to occur in our culture, the hearts of men have to change. Men have to want something
  different. REST knows that resources and relationships are key to cultivating this
  kind of revival in our community and beyond.
section3b_title: Relationships
section3b_body: Our demand reduction team invites sex buyers seeking change to a supportive
  community where freedom from unwanted sexual behavior can be found. Because much
  of sexual sin and addiction is built and thrives in isolation, transparency and
  accountability are paramount. Our hope is for meaningful and sustained transformation.

section3c_title: Resources
section3c_body: REST is in the process of developing a comprehensive online network
  of resources and relationships for sex buyers and men who are experiencing other
  unwanted sexual behavior. We know many men desire change, but may not know where
  to look for help. We want them to know they are not alone and there is hope for
  change.
