section1a_title: You Can Bring Rest
section1a_body: At the core of REST is a passion to see a path of hope made for the
  exploited. We are a direct service provider made up of passionate people who are
  compelled to action by the desire for justice in our city and our state. We want
  Washington to be inhospitable to traffickers and we want to work ourselves out of
  a job. We need your help to do this. Have questions? Email <volunteer@iwantrest.com>.
section1b_title: Attend A Training
section1b_body: As a prerequisite for volunteers, you'll get a better understanding
  of the sex trade and find a team where you can work to bring rest. This training
  is also open to community members who want to consider how they can make a difference
  in Seattle and beyond.

section2a_title: Give
section2a_body: In just a few fast-paced years, REST has gone from a hopeful startup
  to an organization known for providing competent and crucial services to the most
  vulnerable in our community. Our work is impossible without people like you who
  partner with us through generous giving.

section2b_title: Meet A Need
section2b_body: We often hear from small groups looking for service projects or other
  practical ways to give, in addition to time or money. Check out our Needs page to
  see what kinds of goods you can donate to REST. If you have an idea that's not on
  the list, but believe would be of value to us, contact us!

section2c_title: Pray
section2c_body: Prayer is foundational to our work. Prayer Partners are crucial to
  our team. Prayer partners are those who commit to pray regularly for girls, women,
  and men in the sex-trade on their own or with the prayer team that meets weekly
  to pray together.
