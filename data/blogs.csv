There is a lot of talk in recent years about the rise of “slacktivism.” As social media has grown and become an awareness-raising machine, this idea of “slacktivism” has emerged. In short, it is being willing to post/share/comment/like—but be unengaged otherwise. Slacktivism is talking big game about your feelings about issues—but ultimately <i>doing</i> nothing. It is akin to a boat that is ashore. It has potential, but it needs to be brought back into the water to really make the difference that it was intended to.

People have taken note. And people are making changes—and are calling for others to make the same changes—to not just put their money where their mouth (or social media accounts) is, but to put their time, skills, and voice toward some major issues in our world today. And we are so encouraged by this.

We saw a really good example of this shift with the [ALS Foundation’s Ice Bucket Challenge](http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html?referrer=https://www.iwantrest.com/) in 2014. What started as a “either dump ice water over your head—or donate” became a “dump ice water over your head to raise awareness, <i>and</i> donate to raise funds.” Through the call to do <i>more</i> than just talk (and talking is important), the ALS Foundation received $115 million in donations—and that $115 million has enabled incredible steps in their research in the last three years.

We’re not going to ask you to pour ice water over your head. But we are going to ask you to put slacktivism to death, and commit to bringing freedom, safety, and hope to women and girls exploited by the sex trade. We need your voice, time, talents, <i>and</i> money to continue this mission.


We get asked often how people can get involved—so we thought we’d put together a list of ways you can do just that. Here are five ways to make an impact for the hundreds that will be sold for sex in our community tonight:

#####Pray.
Stop reading this blog for a minute, and take a moment to pray for those in Seattle who are being exploited in the sex trade. Take a moment to pray for those purchasing sex in our community. Pray for REST. Pray for your reaction to the rest of this blog. Consider committing to being a prayer partner, and showing up at our [prayer events](https://iwantrest.com/events).
#####Donate.
From operating our REST House, the Emergency Receiving Center Shelter, and Drop-In Center, to having people available to help women seeking to exit the sex trade—and having material resources for them—we need your support. Whether you’re able to make a one-time donation, or become a monthly supporter, or [provide directly for material needs](https://iwantrest.com/needs)—we need your help. [Make a financial donation here](https://iwantrest.com/donate).
#####Get Trained & Volunteer.
There are many ways you can volunteer at REST—and it all starts with attending a [Training Day](https://iwantrest.com/events). We need frontline volunteers as well as people working in the background. [Learn more about volunteering here](https://iwantrest.com/volunteer). One upcoming volunteer need we have is for a volunteer photographer and a few volunteer models for a photoshoot. If you’re interested, email [communication@iwantrest.com](mailto:communication@iwantrest.com).
#####Join us at [A Night of REST](https://iwantrest.com/event/a-night-of-rest-2).
Attend our annual fundraising gala on November 11. Connect with other like-minded people in our community, enjoy dinner, and participate in live and silent auctions to raise funds to bring REST to exploited individuals. [Info & tickets are available here](https://iwantrest.com/event/a-night-of-rest-2).
#####Use your platform.
We know we’re encouraging you to put slacktivism to death—but that doesn’t mean we don’t need [your voice](https://iwantrest.com/blog/3-essential-components-to-winning-the-war-on-human-trafficking-1). It means we need your voice <i>and</i>. We need your voice <i>and</i> your intentional commitment to bring freedom, safety, and hope to those exploited in the commercial sex trade in King County. One new way you can use your voice to very practically help us is by starting a [Facebook Fundraiser](https://www.facebook.com/fundraisers/). Through Facebook Fundraisers, we can collectively, as a community, put our money where our social media mouth is and make a real—visible—tangible—impact. Facebook fans have already raised over $3,200 for REST. $3,200 can keep our ERC Shelter & Drop-In Center open for two days, or provide life skills training for all of the women in the REST house for a year, or help ten survivors escape to a safe, out-of-state location.

You can make a significant impact for those exploited in the commercial sex trade in our community right now—if you’re willing to put slacktivism to death and take action.",blog

the-worlds-terrible-truths-are-never-solved-by-turning-a-blind-eye-other-important-lessons-learned-at-microsofts-2016-oneweek-hackathon,539,"“The World’s Terrible Truths are Never Solved by Turning a Blind Eye,” & Other Important Lesson’s Learned at Microsoft’s 2016 //oneweek Hackathon.",bridget,2016-10-17,"Danielle, a Microsoft employee, volunteered her time to [Hack for Good at Microsoft’s //oneweek Hackathon for REST’s Project Reach Out](https://iwantrest.com/blog/weve-begun-our-year-with-a-real-game-changer) and met a survivor of sex trafficking and employee of REST who privately shared her story to help inform the project participants. Danielle sent us this letter about the profound impact this survivor had on her.
**The survivor’s name has been changed.

*Dear Amy,*
*I’m writing to let you know that you’re wonderful. Thank you for    making the time to come to Microsoft campus and share your story for our //oneweek hackathon project.*
*This was a courageous, generous thing that you did for us. You have remarkable grace under pressure, considering that we put a microphone in front of you and said, “talk.” About your deepest fears and triumphs. About your life as a victim of sex trafficking. About your emotional state, then and now. Tell us everything, and let us record it. Inform our project with your deeply personal history.
I want you to know that regardless of the impact our hackathon project has on others, you’ve affected me profoundly. I was hesitant to join this hackathon team. My reluctance was selfish, driven by my sensitivity and aversion to the state of the world right now. I did not want to open my eyes to this issue. I did not want to invite the effects of another heartbreaking reality. I did not want to learn that Seattle, my community, harbors pervasive sex trafficking. But I knew that was the wrong way to think about it. That the world’s terrible truths are never solved by turning a blind eye.*
*I’ve been inspired by this team and our community partners. There are so many passionate, sincere, and talented people working to find a solution. Or at the very least, encourage progress. It’s especially uplifting to see this group of Microsoft folks come together for a good cause. It’s easy to get lost in our “day jobs,” to stay heads-down in product launches and feature developments. In this, we’re poking our heads into the light. Our collective goal, day after day, is to help you. To help women and young girls everywhere find relief, understanding, and escape.*
*Again, Amy, you’re amazing. You didn’t have to accept our invitation to talk. You didn’t have to bare your heart and soul to us. But you did, and I’m forever grateful. I was nervous to talk to you. I know that I’m privileged, and my life is blessed by good circumstances, good luck, and good relationships. I expected to feel guilty in some way when we met. But you have the unparalleled ability to make those around you feel empowered and enlightened. To share your story in such a way that the only option after hearing it is action. I felt respect and understanding, and the overwhelming desire to help.*
*You told us that you’d live the same life all over again to be able to help one girl who’s in the same situation. That without your experiences, no matter how dark, you couldn’t be the right advocate and champion for others. If you don’t already know, I want to tell you – that’s incredible. That’s the definition of selflessness, and heroism.*
*We can only hope to achieve your level of compassion. Technical solutions are important, but they’re only as good as the human behaviors they mirror. If we build this solution with your spirit and empathy always in mind, we hope to make a real impact.
Thank you for your fortitude. I truly admire you and appreciate your dedication to this cause.*
*All the best,*
*Danielle*

weve-begun-our-year-with-a-real-game-changer,523,We've Begun Our Year with a Real Game Changer,bridget,2016-10-09,"At REST, it seems like we're always up to something big: a resident finishes school and gains a degree, a survivor joins our support group and finds a meaningful community or we celebrate another survivor who has successfully escaped the sex trade for 30 days, 6 months or a year. These last few months have been no different. There is a lot to catch up on, and so much to celebrate!

#####Backpage.com CEO Charged with Pimping
Late last week, several executives, including the CEO of perhaps what can be considered the largest American online brothel, of [backpage.com](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-criminal-charges-against-senior), were arrested on on felony charges of pimping a minor, pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping. Thousands of man hours and likely millions of dollars have been spent in an effort to shut down backpage.com's ads for “escort services” which have made millions of dollars off the illegal sex trade. Although Backpage has continued to call themselves allies to anti-trafficking activists, internal business records obtained through a search warrant show that 99% of its revenue came from its adult services section between January 2013 and March 2015. Backpage.com is not an ally, but a trafficker who hides behind deceptive devices in order to make money off of someone else’s exploitation.

Technology and the internet have fueled this underground marketplace. In fact, over the years, REST has seen the dramatic decline in our ability to reach victims and survivors on the street because sites like backpage.com have facilitated the isolation and anonymity of those who are seeking escape from the sex trade, or are otherwise in need of services. We, as direct-service providers, needed a way to reclaim our access.

#####Our Response
Last year, as part of our partnership with [Seattle Against Slavery](http://www.seattleagainstslavery.org/) (SAS), REST launched new outreach efforts in hopes to let those being sold online know help and hope were available to them, should they desire it. Our partnership provided a way for our advocates to connect with potential victims directly. Through the use of technology, REST was able to ""scrape"" and translate numbers posted in commercial sex ads, and send hundreds of texts each month. We were immediately encouraged by the early results. Victims self-identified and were given individualized support to remove the barriers they faced. We knew this was a powerful tool that we needed to scale, and we also knew that to do this successfully, we needed help.

#####Tech-Industry Employees join REST and SAS to Hack for Good
This summer, REST, along with SAS, was invited to pitch our project idea around text outreach to victims to a team at Microsoft as part of the company’s 2016 //oneweek Hackathon where employees take time off from their day jobs to create, innovate and hack on ideas that inspire them. After a successful pitch, dozens of Microsoft employees joined our Hack for Good team and begun helping us leverage our existing technology in order to improve our efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of our approach to outreach. Sponsored by Microsoft Philanthropies, Hack for Good is a community of Microsoft employees who are passionate about using their technical and business skills to help solve some of the world’s greatest societal problems. Throughout the event, thousands of Microsoft employees viewed our project which received enough votes to win the “Learned Something New” category. We were also awarded first place in the Hack for Good category. And beyond the //oneweek Hackathon effort, many of those employees have continued to dedicate volunteer time to continue to enhance our project. We are beyond grateful for the impact that text outreach has and will continue to have on our community, and are excited about the delivery system we created that will allow other anti-trafficking agencies to do the same. This project represents the best of collaborative efforts.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-10-10-at-11.47.05-PM.png)

And the timing of the enhanced text outreach couldn’t be more ideal with the launch of our long-awaited Emergency Receiving Center!

#####Our Emergency Shelter Opens Next Month
As you know, in just under seven years, REST has provided meaningful services and impacted hundreds and hundreds of lives. When REST opened our residential program for victims of sex trafficking, it was the first for adults in our region. For some of the residents, it has been the safety and stability they’ve needed to move forward and take steps toward a new future. But, for some, and the many who never make it there, the step from homelessness and or drug addiction is too great, and they need an intermediate step. Clients, law enforcement, therapists and other service agencies all agree. There are numerous existing shelters, many of which we have used, but are either inadequate to provide the setting needed to consider long-term stabilization, or are so overrun with the tremendous demand for emergency placement they simply do not have a bed to offer. We know first hand the hardship of this reality, and because of it, our team works for days, or sometimes weeks, finding placement.


![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-10-11-at-12.09.24-AM.png)

In fact, this year alone (July ’15-June ’16), there were no beds available in King County for nearly 40% of women who called the REST hotline looking for a safe place to stay. These brave women took an incredible risk and reached out for help only to be told, “There’s no place for you to go tonight.”

For almost three years, REST has been championing such a place. We call it the Emergency Receiving Center (ERC). We’ve spent the better part of a year researching best trauma-informed practices, vetting properties, building financial support, writing job descriptions, hiring team members and more because we are convinced closing this gap will be a game-changer for victims of human trafficking.
Starting this November, the ERC will serve identified/self-reported victims of sex trafficking and those seeking escape from the sex trade referred to REST by partnering local law enforcement, other referral agencies, and the REST 24-hour hotline. The ERC will provide 30-60 days of emergency housing, intensive case management, and daytime programming to help guests begin to stabilize and consider what life free from exploitation looks and feels like.

The ERC will also serve young women who have already accessed long-term housing programs but have since become destabilized in their environment. Rather than returning to the streets, or back to a trafficker, they will have the option of utilizing the ERC as a safety net to rebuild stability and then re-engage with their long-term goals.

The annual cost of the running the 7-bed ERC is a $550,000+ program which will provide more than 2,500 nights of shelter for victims of human trafficking. While the cost will be significant for this program, so will be the impact. Imagine when our 24-hour hotline rings with someone looking to escape a violent trafficker, having them hear, “There is a safe place for you to go tonight, and a team of people dedicated to helping you.” Imagine the impact of increased coordination between social service agencies and local police who have an immediate place to bring victims of human trafficking when rescued. Imagine a place where people who have escaped those same experiences are waiting to say, “If I did it, you can too.” We are elated to provide such a place, and we hope you will consider continued partnership with REST to make it possible. The ERC cost also includes expanded drop-in services including daily classes, support groups, and workshops.

#####What’s Next
We do hold on to the belief that one day WA State will become inhospitable to the trafficking of people, and our hope continues to be to work ourselves out of a job. Until then, there are thousands of people, locally, right now, who seek critical support to leave the sex trade behind and begin to heal from the violence and trauma they have endured. Our work: text outreach, the emergency shelter, the 24/7 crisis intervention line, the residential program, Thrive and more, depends on you. Thank you for joining our efforts and making this possible. You are the game-changer.

when-sex-trafficking-is-a-family-affair,351,When Sex Trafficking is a Family Affair,bridget,2016-05-14,"A couple of weeks ago, [we posted a story](http://komonews.com/news/local/wsp-arrests-6-in-child-exploitation-operation-in-snohomish-county?platform=hootsuite) involving six local men who were arrested during an undercover operation that involved child rape & domestic minor sex trafficking.  These men ranged in age, race and profession. They lived in major cities, and in the outlying suburbs. As you can imagine, the story sparked strong reactions from our readers, most of whom were outraged because the men believed they were arranging sex acts with a mother of three who was seeking to profit off of her children's rapes. And, the article went on to highlight that in the past few months, the city’s two-person detective task force made more than 30 arrests for similar child sex crimes.

For many of us, our stomachs ‘drop’ as our eyes scan a headline as heinous and unfathomable as child sexual abuse. And even fewer of us manage to click and read the details. That gut reaction is normal and is one of the ways our bodies alert us to something ‘off’ or dangerous.

When I hear or read stories that involve familial trafficking, my stomach drops too. Almost every time I get that sensation, I cannot help but think about the number of times that child’s stomach alerted them to the impending danger as their trafficker approached, but didn’t have the option to avoid knowing the details.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Stocksy_txpc70e2bfc6Ty000_Small_986319.jpg)

Familial Trafficking is when a family member abuses their power and exploits the vulnerabilities of the child, thrusting them into a trafficking situation. Familial Trafficking can be motivated by many things, including financial survival or gain, or 'legacy,' (generational sexual abuse), but it always involves a corruption of power:

* A mother who has been raped and her child is a reminder of the violence, so she punishes her…
* A child who was born into a family where incest and exploitation have been passed down for generations…
* An extended family member who sexually abuses a child, and profits off of others who want to do the same…
* A parent who grooms their teenager because that's the only job the parent has ever had...
* A drug-addicted or desperate caregiver who sells their child because they are the only thing of value they have, and they don’t know how else to meet their needs…
* A teen who experienced sexual assault and rape who then sells a younger family member and they don’t understand why, but it helps them feel less of their pain…
* A step-parent who marries into a family to sexually abuse, and profit off of selling child porn…

For each of the scenarios listed above, the incest and trafficking are not motivated by sex, but power which makes it extremely confusing for the child. The abuse often becomes normalized at a young age because family members have early access. It becomes extremely complicated for the victim to speak out about the violence because of the family dynamic of love, loyalty, shame, dependence, and fear of abandonment. What's more, because Familial Trafficking also involves [violence within what should be a caregiver relationship](https://iwantrest.com/blog/when-trauma-exists-in-the-caregiver-child-relationship), healing is often much more complex.

Of course, many survivors of child sexual abuse and trafficking are not ready to talk about what happened to them. It is an incredibly brave, but extremely vulnerable thing to do. But, for those who are ready, whether because they believe it’s part of their healing journey, or because they feel empowered and want to prevent others from suffering in silence, they need compassionate listeners. While it may be instinctual to want to shrink from hearing about someone’s pain, we must resist. We cannot add to a survivor’s suffering by listening insensitively, or by inadvertently sending a message that they are “too much” for us.

> ####“Shared sorrow is endurable sorrow,”
                                          -Bob Kellerman

Most of us are not professional counselors and cannot provide certain insights, nor should we underestimate the sacredness of the invitation. But, we can listen intently, without probing. We can offer compassion and empathy, if not by our words, then by our presence. Our presence can bear witness to not only the experience of suffering but to the determination and resiliency of the human spirit. And that is humanizing for the person sharing their pain.  And for those of us who are privileged enough to join them, even briefly, in their journey, they give us an extraordinary gift too.  Awe transcends our fear, and our understanding of the world is changed forever.",blog
two-things-you-can-do-today-to-support-human-trafficking-victims-hb-2668-sb-5277,315,Two Things You Can Do Today To Support Human Trafficking Victims: HB 2668 & SB 5277,bridget,2016-02-22,"Trauma recovery, especially for people who have experienced ongoing terrorizing physical and sexual violence, is an arduous and painful path.  The seemingly insurmountable roadblocks when attempting post-trafficking recovery is no exception.  Victims of human trafficking, as a result of their trauma, often suffer from anxiety, panic disorders, depression, eating disorders, intrusive thoughts (e.g. flashbacks and nightmares), avoidance or numbing of trauma-related stimuli (e.g. avoiding certain places, people, and situations), hyper-arousal, difficulties controlling emotions and/or concentrating, suicidality, and alterations in consciousness (dissociation disorders).  It should be no surprise to learn, given the long list of negative and pervasive intrusions trauma brings, that many victims of trauma have used, or been forced to use, drugs and alcohol to cope.  Substances offer a perverse freedom from the overwhelming feelings trauma brings, only to add to the long list of recovery work.

Suffice it to say, trauma recovery takes incredible resilience and bravery. But that’s not all.  Beyond the therapeutic and chemical dependency recovery processes, victims of trafficking must also face the poverty-inducing effects of their resulting criminal records.  One common experience is participation in other criminal acts when they were under the control of a pimp or trafficker.  Some run drugs because it provides another, less violent, means of meeting quotas set by their trafficker.  Others face criminal convictions for public intoxication, loitering, theft, breaking and entering, domestic violence charges and others.

Their resulting criminal record hinders victims from getting housing, employment, getting a loan, or from adjusting their immigration status.  Their criminal convictions are used against them during child custody hearings.  Essentially, although they were victims of a crime, they continue to pay the dire consequences for the crimes they committed under duress.  They are re-victimized.  Making escape from exploitation extremely daunting.

Recently, Washington State introduced [HB 2668](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2015-16/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/2668%20HBR%20PS%2016.pdf) that expands [HB 1292](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?year=2013&bill=1292), which allows victims of human trafficking to petition a judge when certain conditions are met to clear their criminal records of prostitution-related convictions. Current law limits the ability for this vacation of convictions only when the offender has committed no another crime. This new bill proposes the removal of the stipulation of no other criminal acts and provides an important pathway for those who committed an offense as a result of being a victim of trafficking.

Last month at the public hearing, several trafficking survivors testified:

*“But I found what was happening is I couldn’t find a job, I couldn’t get an apartment,” she said. “I had a kid that I was trying to fight and get back, but those charges just didn’t look good for me.”-SH*
*“If you talked to my sister right now she would say,’what’s the point? I’ve been in over half my life, look at this list of charges.’ She’s been under the control of pimps since she was 14. So why get out now,” -SH*
*“It’s really sad to get a call from a fellow survivor who is doing amazing, that’s crying and crying saying, ‘I can’t get a job that pays a living wage because of my convictions,’” -JM*

Other survivors have spoken out similarly:

*“I’m thinking I’m going to hit [the convictions] and it’s going to just knock me back down…People in my life today have no idea of where I’ve been. And I’d like to keep it that way. It’s none of their business.”– MR*
*“We can’t get jobs. It ruins our lives,”- LC*
*“People judged you. It was very shaming,” said another survivor of how it felt to constantly get rejected from jobs for which she was often overqualified.*

Washington State has led the way with anti-human trafficking legislation.  We were first in the nation with anti-trafficking laws and still have some of the most comprehensive anti-trafficking laws. This legislative support allows direct service providers more flexibility, and it gives survivors more hope.

Please show your support and [ensure your legislators know](https://app.leg.wa.gov/pbc/) you want convictions for prostitution removed from survivor’s records if they’ve been victims of trafficking.

[SB 5277](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=5277&year=2015)
Often, men who buy sex do so knowing that there’s a likely chance that the women involved in prostitution are under the control of a pimp and trafficker.  In fact, one study found that 66% of sex buyers observed that a majority of women are lured, tricked or trafficked into prostitution, yet the consequences of using exploited people in Washington have only resulted in a simple misdemeanor.

The Washington State has been pursuing curbing demand for commercial sex by shifting the focus from prostitution-related crimes to policing and prosecuting purveyors of sex and those demanding it.  [SB 5277](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=5277&year=2015) proposes to increase the offense’s maximum penalty from a simple misdemeanor to a gross misdemeanor which may result in 90 - 365 days in jail.

Please show your support and [ensure your legislators know](https://app.leg.wa.gov/pbc/) you want increased penalties for  sex buyers.


HB 2668 was sponsored by Representatives [Tina Orwall](9http://housedemocrats.wa.gov/legislators/tina-orwall/), [Goodman](https://app.leg.wa.gov/pbc/memberEmail/45/1), Senn, Riccelli, and Ormsby.

More than 1.5 million people were displaced, and 300,000 structures were severely damaged or destroyed. Some cities near the epicenter reported 90% of their buildings lost. The amount of devastation was incomprehensible. Five weeks later, Chile was struck by an earthquake 500 times more powerful than the Haitian quake, yet the damage and the death toll in Chile paled in comparison. Why was Chile able to largely withstand the violence, while Haiti crumbled?

According to experts, much of the destruction can be attributed to Haiti’s lack of building codes. Without sufficient regulations, builders used additives such as limestone dust and sand that produced substandard concrete and built structures without adequate rebar support making them vulnerable to collapse. It’s clear when structures with weak or non-existent foundations meet enough violence, they crumble.

Although not a perfect analogy, a helpful comparison can be made to infants who experience attachment-trauma. Attachment-trauma happens when over time a primary caregiver - the person the infant relies on for survival - becomes a source of danger through maltreatment such as abuse, neglect, and abandonment. Similar to concrete additives, relational trauma significantly compromises trust foundations of infants and children. Typically, the greater the magnitude of weakening, the greater the impact on the foundation.

When a child encounters trouble or needs help, the child instinctively elicits the help of their caretaker by crying and other strategies to gain their attention. When the caregiver responds with care and concern, the child becomes reassured and eventually returns to exploring their world. The child becomes confident that help is available if they need it. This confidence provides the security a child needs to process the massive amount of daily new experiences. Then, they are able to develop a range of skills, including the ability to regulate their body and emotions, to understand self and others, and over time, develop increasingly sophisticated cognitive, emotional and developmental competencies. <sup>(1)</sup>

But, when trauma exists in the caregiver-child relationship, the child’s developing brain has little ability to manage the contradiction. The contradiction quickly overwhelms their limited coping skills and redirects its energy from healthy development to parts of the brain associated with the fight, flight, and freeze survival responses. While this redirection of brain function helps the child survive, it often leads to developmental delays, hyper-vigilance, skewed perceptions of self and others, disconnection from their feelings, and other unhealthy coping skills. As they age, without positive attachment intervention, these reactive behaviors can become maladaptive and even crumble.

###Experts have identified three common responses to Attachment-Trauma: <sup>(2)</sup>

*Avoidant-attachment*

One reaction to attachment trauma is avoidance. With avoidant-attachment, a child expects rejection from a caregiver, so they actively avoid caregivers. They learn to suppress their natural desire to seek out comfort when frightened, distressed, or in pain. Children with an avoidant attachment may show no partiality between a parent and a complete stranger. As adults, they often avoid intimacy and experience little distress when a relationship ends.

*Resistant-attachment*

Preoccupation is another reaction to attachment trauma. With resistant-attachment, the child feels insecure. They tend to vacillate between seeking and resisting contact with a caregiver. There are often exaggerated expressions of attachment needs, including a preoccupation with attention from the caregiver and a reluctance to explore their world. When a caregiver departs, typically the infant or child becomes extremely distressed. As adults, they worry that others may not love them and can be easily frustrated or angered when their attachment needs go unmet.

*Disorganized/disoriented- Attachment*

With disorganized-attachment, the person is fearful of relationships and struggles to find a successful way of interacting with those they desire. When their need for emotional closeness remains unresponded to, and the caregiver’s behavior is erratic and unpredictable, they often become confused, dazed, frozen or use mixed strategies. They often have difficulty in regulating emotions and in reading social cues. As an adult, they may struggle to express love and affection and be unresponsive to their partner’s needs. If affection is withheld, they may be enraged and abusive.

Let me clearly state that not every person who has been trafficked for commercial sex has experienced attachment trauma. But, this disruptive, early childhood violence adds to the laundry list of vulnerabilities that increase the likelihood a person experiences exploitation. It is crucial that direct service providers understand and respond to this complexity by providing trauma-informed practices.

Trauma-informed practices consider potential impacts trauma has on a person’s worldview and coping strategies. It offers informed help to promote understanding and healing. It sees a person beyond just their specific traumatic experience by considering biological, relational, emotional, cultural, spiritual, and other influences. It takes a strengths-based approach to care that seeks to identify and utilize a person’s unique characteristics, skills, relational supports, experiences, and others assets. This care model’s primary focus shifts from problems or deficits to the inherent resources a person has which they can use to counteract challenges. It encourages service providers to take a cooperative role by increasing opportunities so that people can make informed decisions because it believes people are experts of their lives. Ultimately, it affirms the inherent dignity and equality of all people because they are image-bears of God.

10-things-not-to-say-when-meeting-a-sex-trafficking-survivor,139,10 Things Not To Say When Meeting A Survivor of Sex Trafficking,bridget,2015-04-21,"We mean well. We don’t intend to be insensitive. But sometimes our words are still hurtful to those who have experienced commercial sexual exploitation. With the help of some people who’ve felt the effect of unintentionally damaging words first-hand, we’ve created this list so we can better communicate love to these individuals.

*1). ""What was it like when (insert painful detail I shared) happened? Tell me more.""*

This is one of the most uncomfortable things you could ask me. On one hand, I'm glad you listened to me. On the other hand, your question feels intrusive. I've shared exactly as much detail with you as I wanted to, and I'm probably feeling vulnerable and raw. Instead, thank me for sharing. Encourage me. Or just smile and let me know you care.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Stocksy_txpcb44483eW7Z000_Large_540193.jpg)

*2). ""But you were born in America! I thought sex trafficking only happened in poor, third-world countries.""*

The exploitation of vulnerable populations isn't unique to one part of the world. Yes, it even happens here in America. If you’re shocked that commercial sexual exploitation happens in your city and state, say that! Don’t use me to verbally process this newly discovered reality.

*3). ""I can't believe that happened to you.""*

It might not be your intention, but you are communicating disbelief about my painful experiences. Most survivors spend years finding their voices. Many of us battle daily with feeling like we won't be believed and that our voices don't matter. Instead, if you'd like to express your heartbreak, I welcome hearing ""I'm so sorry,” or ""I am devastated to learn that these things happen in our world. Thank you for sharing.""

*4). ""But you're white!"" or “But you speak English!”*

I cannot tell you how often I've heard this blurted out. Sexual violence and human trafficking know no racial or ethnic boundaries. Comments about a survivor's ethnicity, race, culture, or country of origin are unhelpful and inadvertently send the message that exploitation is more acceptable for people of color.

*5). ""You don't look like a prostitute; I would have never known.”*

I don't know what you expect me to say to this one. While this is probably intended as a compliment, it's an awful thing to hear. What you've communicated is that society places a divide between us: you're the normal one, while I'm other, the damaged one. If people knew the real me, I would be defined only by what has happened to me.

*6). “If it was so bad, why didn’t you leave?” Or “why didn’t you call the police?”*

This question feels not only shaming, but it reveals how little you know about the dynamics of sex trafficking - the force, the fraud, the coercion. It shows you don’t understand the complexity of trauma, or the violence we might endure if we attempt to leave. I know it’s nearly impossible for you to put yourself in my shoes, but instead of subtly shifting blame to me, celebrate with me that I’m now free.

*7). “God, (insert religious platitude).”*

Religious platitudes are a no-no. These are statements that imply a specific belief system about how the world works and the interaction between good and evil. I've heard ""Karma is going to come around to get your abusers,” ""God turns all things out for good!,” and many others. That thought might bring you comfort, but unless you've got intimate knowledge of my personal beliefs, it's best not to assume where I am in the process of reconciling the spiritual implications of my experiences. However, brief, kind, and neutral words such as, “I'll say a prayer for you,"" ""Sending you positive thoughts,” and ""May God bless you” are some of my favorite things and communicate that you wish me well.

*8). “Hey! I recognize you from that event (or conversation) where you spoke about your childhood and sex trafficking!”*

If you run into me outside the specific venue in which I've chosen to share my story, please don't intrude. Even if you mean well and want to thank me for sharing my story, you've interrupted me at a moment when I might not be ready to wade into my pain. Take a moment to put yourself in my shoes. I'm a human being with dignity, just like you. Do you want one of your most shame-filled memories broadcast to all the other parents at the park, your boss, or the waiter bringing your meal? It’s my choice when, where, and with whom I share my story.

*9). “Is ____ your real name?” or “can I get your contact information?”*

When I’m speaking at a venue, I’ve decided what I’m willing to share. If I choose to use a pseudonym or do not provide contact information, it is because I didn’t want to give out personal details. By asking for my real name or my contact information, you’re invading my privacy. I’ve worked incredibly hard to feel empowered and free to use my voice again; don’t use your voice to silence my choices. If there’s a legitimate reason or opportunity you’d like me to know about, contact the event coordinator who can ask me directly, so I don’t feel pressured to make a rash decision.

*10). “Would you come and speak at my event for free?”*

While most people would not be so direct, many people ask me to share my story without compensating me. Unless I offer, asking me to work for free is another form of exploitation. Instead, consider me like any keynote speaker and offer a fair amount. I’m reasonable and want to help, but I have bills too.

Note from Bridget: I wrote this blog with my dear friend, a survivor of sex trafficking. We want to honor the voices of several other women who contributed their voices and experiences to this conversation. We are grateful for their powerful contributions.",blog
a-survivors-story-meet-mia,137,A Survivor’s Story:  Meet Mia,bridget,2015-03-26,"I spent my childhood being trafficked for sex. When I was five years old, I was raped by my stepfather and uncle. Soon, my stepfather began to pass me around to his friends. This quickly escalated into strangers paying my stepfather for time with me and eventually being sold to a larger client base across multiple states. My days were lived in sleazy motel rooms, in strange cars, and in the brief breaks between the pain. My life was numbered in how many men he would force me to service each day and the hours spent making his child porn movies and pictures. I didn’t know any life other than being perpetually exploited and abused. I had no dignity and no hope.

At age ten, I went into the foster care system for the first time. I was raped my first night at my first placement. For years I bounced around between different foster care situations and my mother’s (and stepfather's) custody. Men continued to use me and take advantage of me. It seemed like no matter where I turned, I was raped and treated as a sexual commodity. I was numb from the years of pain and abuse.

I couldn’t imagine my life being any different. I saw other people living lives that weren’t marked by rape and abuse. Theoretically, I understood that it was possible for a person to exist without being a sexual commodity. But I didn’t know how to make that happen for me. It was as though these other people had some basic level of humanity that I hadn’t been granted. I lived in the world of Money-For-Sex and spoke only that language. People who didn't live in that world were speaking a foreign language I had no hope of understanding. I desperately wished for another life, but knew it was some unattainable dream. Being prostituted for years crushed my soul, seemingly beyond repair. Being raped and harmed was all I knew.

Even after my circumstances changed and I was no longer being bought by men, my life was still in shambles. I hadn’t learned healthy self care skills or how to engage in positive relationships. I was driven and motivated to fight for my new life, but lacked a vision or roadmap for where I was going. In many ways, I was just as lost as I was before. I knew that God was real, but didn’t understand why he was relevant to my life. My grief over what I’d been through was always lurking just under the surface of my frantic attempts to manage my life. I lived in fear of what others would think when they learned my story. I was ashamed and anxious about my history. I simultaneously wished I was invisible and desperately ached to be known. Loneliness and fear consumed me.
My husband knew the vague details of my painful history, but I couldn’t fight through my blind panic to allow him to actually know me. Even though he never raped or abused me, I was terrified of trusting him. We were still newlyweds, yet it seemed as though we were simultaneously strangers and enemies.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Mias_Photo.png)

Through the fog of my pain, a single ray of light and hope burst through: Love. Love trickled into my life slowly, eventually turning into a flood that saturated every part of my being. My husband tempered his frustrated outbursts into loving efforts to listen. Accepting that he loved me as a person and didn't see me as a commodity was transformational. There was a moment at the beginning of my healing process when I sat in my pastor’s office, grasping my husband’s hand for courage as I shared a broken piece of my heart and story. I watched a tear stream down my pastor’s cheek as he kept eye contact with me and carefully listened to my faltering words. It hit me in that moment: This is how God sees me. He sees my pain and weeps with me. I’m not invisible or insignificant to him.

I slowly accepted the truth that God loves me. I am his precious daughter. I'm not a prostitute. I am a survivor, not a victim. I've endured a mountain of pain and suffering, but I have survived. I have dignity and worth as a human being. Even though I often feel very weak and small, I know I am brave and strong.

It has taken an army of people to help me build a new life, far removed from the world of Money-For-Sex. Faithful friends surround me, offering both practical help and encouragement. A wise couple have become mentors and parent figures to me, lavishing unconditional love on me and my family. Another dear couple have become my older brother and sister, offering their listening ears and thoughtful counsel. A series of therapists and counselors have helped me understand the impact of complex PTSD on my body and mind, trained me in survival skills, and offered wisdom specific to my situation. My doctors help provide cohesive physical care to complement my emotional and mental healing. Solid legal advice has helped me untangle some complexity that remains from my past. I've been fortunate to have pastors that remind me of God's love for me and the hope that is available to me as his precious daughter.

I begin to choke up with tears when I remember all of my helpers - the people who cheer me on, love me, and hope the best for me when I run out of strength to hope for myself. My helpers aren't people with Christian platitudes, trite sayings, or judgemental attitudes. They are fellow imperfect human beings who don't pretend they have all the answers. I’ve often been challenging to love, which makes it all the sweeter when people persevere in relationship with me.

I read this quote about love a few years ago and it has stuck with me.

""Love isn't a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like struggle. To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way he or she is, right here and now."" -Fred Rogers

Over the course of my life, I've been horrifically harmed at the hands of other people. I find it humbling and beautiful to realize that I've also received incredible love and help from the hands of other people. Accepting kindness from others who respect my humanity heals deep wounds on my heart. Love doesn't exist in a vacuum or in isolation. Love happens in connection and relationship with God and other people.

Healing my soul has been a slow journey. It's not over yet. Even though I've come so far, my soul is still deeply scarred. Most days, I battle discouragement, isolation, and anxiety. Even though I have a new life and can stumble through learning a new language and skills, it requires all of my focus and determination. I need to cling to Jesus to give me the courage to face the day and get out of bed each morning. Life is often hard and full of challenges. Because of my story, I struggle to feel like I fit in with decent society. In the past month, I've been both gaped at and marginalized because of my history.

It still seems surreal as I look around my safe home at my husband and children. I can't wrap my head around living in a place and with people where I'm not worried about being physically harmed. Is this real? Will this new safe life last, or will I get sucked back into misery?

But through it all and in the midst of my doubts, I can cling tightly onto love and hope. Love is what God feels for me. Love is embodied in the dear people who fill my life. Love anchors me in the light and assures me I won't be swept back into terror and darkness.

If you are a survivor of sex trafficking or prostitution, know you are not alone. You are not defined by what happened to you or what you have done. You are God’s precious child. He loves you. There is hope. God will not abandon you to be destroyed by evil or consumed by your pain.

If you are stumbling along, trying to build a new life and often feel like you are lost, there is STILL hope. Jesus loves you, even when you feel like a failure. He cares that you hurt and grieves over what happened. Cling tightly to the love you find in the midst of your struggle.

The wreckage from sex trafficking is vast. It is as though a powerful bomb goes off, crumbling a giant mountain all around you. You're standing there bloodied and weak, perhaps trapped under some debris. There are large boulders blocking your way every where you turn. It's not an overnight process to rebuild your life and find a path that leads into the light.

Love shines a light into the darkness and grabs your hand to guide you to safety. Love stays by your side and won't abandon you. Love listens. Love is patient and compassionate. There is hope because there is love.
""Love is patient, love is kind. ... It is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered... [Love] always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.""-1 Corinthians 13:4-8

50-shades-of-propaganda-how-you-are-being-indoctrinated-to-sexual-violence,135,50 Shades of Propaganda: How You Are Being Indoctrinated To Sexual Violence,bridget,2015-02-11,"I’ve always been particularly fascinated by World War II. More specifically, how Adolf Hitler was able to convince hundreds of thousands of ordinary people to participate in, or at least tolerate, the systematic massacre of more than six million people during his reign. How were so many people able to abandon their professional and moral objections and participate in such atrocities? This question still haunts me.

This summer I had the chance to visit Washington DC’s Holocaust Museum. It was nothing short of tremendous. From the moment I stepped off the elevator, I felt the weight of the world gone terribly wrong. From the piles of shoes taken from prisoners who were gassed to death, then reissued to those still living, to the standard-issue striped pajamas that hung off the side of a metal bunk, I was confronted by the very humanity that had somehow been forgotten during the Holocaust. I wanted to understand. What does this slippery slope to conformity look like? Could I, could we, be at risk?

Included in the museum was The Propaganda Exhibit, which helped unlock some of this mystery that had been plaguing me. Propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate opinions and redirect behaviors, in order to achieve an intended end. Hitler, himself, said of the tactic, “Propaganda is a truly terrible weapon in the hands of an expert,” and he was an expert. And through its use, Hitler was able to sway hundreds of thousands of people to think and act in ways that that, not long before, would have been impossible for them to conceive.

As I walked through the exhibit, confronted by the large, accusing posters, it struck me that there seem to be at least three central steps to effective propaganda campaigns: desensitize, normalize and marginalize. Although it’s been many months since I visited the Holocaust Museum, I recognize these same steps that have moved our culture to think and act in ways we, too, would have never believed.

Tomorrow, the movie adaptation of “global phenomenon” Fifty Shades of Grey will be released in theaters, after selling more than 100 million books worldwide. Fifty Shades of Grey, billed as “romantic erotica,” tells the fictitious story of a Seattle billionaire who enlists a woman to be an object of his degrading and violent sexual acts. The billionaire is partial to BDSM—a term encompassing the practices of bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism. The woman must sign a contract, agreeing to full submission - relinquishing control over her body, diet, hygiene, sleep, and wardrobe.

<b>DESENSITIZATION</b>

We know desensitization has already begun because even while reading that last paragraph, your reaction is likely less extreme than when you first heard of the book/film. That is how desensitization works - what is unfamiliar is slowly and purposefully introduced more and more, until we no longer react, as we once would have. Indulge me for a moment and ponder how this kind of content, sadism and sexual violence, has become a mainstream attraction, let alone a “global phenomenon.”

Desensitization results in the brain turning off emotional responses when witnessing harm done to others. The result is apathy. We become numb. In fact, one recent study_ found that parents who were repeatedly exposed to violence and sexual content became progressively more accepting of the material and, in turn, allowed their children to watch sexually explicit material at increasingly younger ages.

<b>NORMALIZATION</b>

It should come as no surprise that music, television, and movies have more references to sexual violence than ever before. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, 50% of PG movies now depict sex and violence_. Another study revealed that more than 63% of prime time television shows contained sexual exploitation of women. And we, as a culture, are growing more accustomed to it through saturation.

This is the very process Hitler used some 75 years ago. “People are so used to it, they don’t get upset any more,” said one German physician. But, let me say clearly, sexual violence is not “normal,” and we should cringe every time we see it - not pay money, buy popcorn and coke, and expect to be entertained by it. What are we doing?

<b>MARGINALIZATION</b>

Indoctrination demands conformity. All opposing views and criticism are silenced - if not by might, by marginalization. During Hitler’s reign, there were pockets of people who opposed his ideology and refused to be lulled to sleep by the rhythmic waves of his propaganda campaign. Other rebels were marginalized by criticisms of their intelligence, allegiance, and social statuses. We can see this same trajectory as it relates to pornography. Porn began on the periphery of society, but has now become not only “normal,” but also a so-called “healthy part” of our relationships. Now, those who believe porn to be destructive are labeled the minority and dismissed as prude.

Sexual violence is not normal. Rape and torture are not entertainment. Sexual violence is devastating to the millions of people who endure it. At REST, we have seen its consequences first hand. Some of you may make the distinction that the woman in Fifty Shades of Grey, ""opted-in.” But, in the majority of cases of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic violence, exploited people appear they’ve chosen to participate, only later to say that felt powerless and lacked agency. Don’t be fooled.

What’s more, of course, the one who dominates has money and power and he uses those resources to recruit someone who does not. His desire for control is never satisfied. He uses his money and power to isolate her, including by buying the company she works for. This is the same message that many exploiters use: “There’s no use running. I am everywhere. There is no way out.”

Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, leaves us with this powerful reminder: “There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.”",blog
trauma-the-brain-how-a-fraction-of-a-second-can-change-your-life,133,Trauma & the Brain: How a Fraction of a Second Can Change Your Life,bridget,2015-01-06,"Several years ago, I was sitting on my couch, enjoying the silence that only a parent of small children can appreciate. The digital clock on our DVD player told me I was up too late, but the stillness of that hour was a refuge to my ears and soul. The silence was immediately interrupted by the sound of our sliding glass door being unlatched. The sound was familiar to me, for many times I had found myself on the outside of this locked door while my children delighted in the success of their game from the inside. This time, though, I immediately felt that this familiar sound was not safe. With my heart pounding in my chest, I sprung to my feet, and, as I raced past the door, my eyes scanned the door’s track. My fears were momentarily alleviated when I saw the wooden stick securely in place, acting as a second barrier. I flew up the stairs and into my kitchen, knowing I needed to check our upstairs slider. I scanned the dark room, my fears intensifying when I noticed a small amount of money sitting on the kitchen island in plain view of the glass pane. With what felt like the poise and grace of a track star jumping hurdles, I grabbed the money off the counter and slid the lock closed on the kitchen door. I paused briefly while deciding what to do next.

##Sounding the Alarm

Most people are vaguely familiar with our instinctual response to danger: fight, flight or freeze. For those unfamiliar, this physiological reaction to perceived danger occurs in all animals, from house cats to human beings.

Information comes into the brain from various sensory organs and is sent to the Thalamus. The Thalamus asks itself, “Am I safe?” The Prefrontal Cortex and other thinking areas of the brain, then consider this information and ask themselves, “Is this sound or sight familiar to me? What should I do in response?” After processing the information, the Prefrontal Cortex sends a signal to the Amygdala.

The Amygdala, a small almond-shaped structure highly responsive to sights and sounds, is the area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing. It is responsible for quickly recruiting many areas of the brain when a threat is perceived. If it perceives danger, it instantly “sounds the alarm” to the Hypothalamus. The Hypothalamus is like a command center. This area of the brain communicates with the rest of the body through the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).

ANS is a network of nerve fibers that extend throughout the body connecting the brain with various organs and muscle groups in order to coordinate the two branches of this response. Two main nervous systems immediately spring into response: the sympathetic and parasympathetic.

##Preparing for Battle

The sympathetic branch activates the fight or flight response. It is, essentially, the body’s natural heating system. Adrenaline rushes through the body, getting the muscles ready for emergency battle. Surface blood vessels constrict so any bleeding will be minimized. Vision heightens as pupils constrict. Breathing and heart rate speed up as more oxygen is channeled to the muscles. All nonessential processes, such as digestion, cease, in order to optimize the body’s output. The body sometimes even unloads extra weight by emptying the bladder or bowels. The brain is preparing to fight or flee, so you can fight harder, run faster, see better, and breathe easier than you normally would. All of this happens in a fraction of one second.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Watch.png)

These experiences, like the click of the lock on the sliding glass door and the actions that followed, are then carefully stored in the Hippocampus. The Hippocampus catalogs these experiences in the long-term memory to be recalled when needed, attaching memories to the emotions and senses that went with them. For instance, it will link a memory of camping to the smell of campfire smoke. Later, when that person smells campfire smoke, the feeling of that particular camping experience returns along with the smell.

The second ANS responder is the Parasympathetic System. The Parasympathetic System is essentially the cooling system. It tells the body, “OK, you can relax now. The danger has passed. No need to be on red-alert anymore.” It slows down the heart, dilates the pupils, and stimulates digestion. It returns the body to its normal state.

Trauma is danger. If the trauma is prolonged, extreme or repetitive, it can actually physically injure the brain. The brain can eventually learn to bypass the rational part of itself, creating hyper-vigilance. The pathways from the Thalamus to the Amygdala become worn and familiar. The best analogy is that the Amygdala stays in the alert state so long that it gets “stuck,” because danger is always lurking. This puts a glitch in the body’s ability to heat and cool.

With the Parasympathetic System, the “cooling system,” being essentially turned off, the filing system of the Hippocampus stays mostly “offline,” so the Hippocampus fails to put the right time stamp on all the events. Traumatic events are fragmented, disconnected memories. Those memories become corrupt and filled with gaps. The body keeps sensing danger and sending out stress response signals as if the person is continually living in the traumatic moment.

##PTSD & Complex PTSD

A single traumatic event can cause [Post Traumatic Stress Disorder](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml) (PTSD). The longer the vigilant state lasts, the higher the chances of permanent damage which can lead to what many experts now distinguish as [Complex PTSD](http://ptsd.about.com/od/ptsdbasics/a/ComplexPTSD.htm). The PTSD sufferer is unable to distinguish danger from safety of a current event. Current, safe events trigger flashbacks and other strange memories or emotional signals, so the brain keeps retriggering itself into the hyper-alert state. Each new challenge and event seems as dangerous as the last.

###TRAUMA’S PREVALENCE IN CHILDREN

Trauma’s consequences are intensified in children because their brains are still forming and they have fewer reference points stored in the Hippocampus. In the US, approximately 3 million children are reportedly abused or neglected each year [1]; at least 15 out of every 1000 children in the United States have substantiated histories of abuse.

###TRAUMA’S PREVALENCE IN ADULTS

Women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD. In a random sample of 1,225 females, 18.4% reported a history of childhood sexual abuse, 14.2% reported physical abuse, and 24.1% reported having been emotionally abused during childhood. [2] In a national survey, 27% of women and 16% of men had a history of childhood sexual abuse. [3]

###TRAUMA IN TRAFFICKED WOMEN

Trafficked women are two times more likely than a solider in a war zone to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, [4] and 68% of female sex trafficking victims meet the clinical criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. [5]

###6 CRITERIA FOR A PTSD DIAGNOSIS [6]

1. The person goes through or sees something that involves threat of serious injury or death. The person responds to this with intense fear, helplessness or horror.
2. The person then relives this traumatic event through dreams or recollections. He or she can behave as if the trauma is actually happening right then and can react strongly to events that even resemble the original trauma.
3. The person tries desperately to avoid this, and to avoid anything associated with the trauma. He or she may not even remember the trauma, yet may still react strongly to certain stimuli.
4. The person often has difficulty sleeping and concentrating. He or she may be hyper-vigilant.
5. The person experiences prolonged responses lasting longer than one month.
6. The person experiences significant distress in daily life.

PTSD is immobilizing. It is not misdirected thinking, or sign of weak character. It most certainly is not something one can “just get over.” Very real consequences exist for those who suffer from the effects of trauma, including panic attacks, insomnia, and depression. Many sufferers also experience relational and social effects, including retaliation or ostracism, leading to additional complexities.
So, if you are inclined to work with victims of trauma, including those exploited for commercial sex, do your due diligence to understand its effects. Get trained, be patient and compassionate, and be in it for the long haul.

give-for-goodness-sakeand-for-yours,3,Give for Goodness’ Sake…and for Yours,bridget,2014-12-20,"Tonight, hundreds of children and thousands of women are being exploited for commercial sex in our city.  Night after night, in hotel rooms, in area homes, and in cars parked along our city streets, girls and young women are raped for profit.

With the growing awareness around anti trafficking efforts, it’s likely you’ve heard these staggering numbers before. I know familiarity can often lead to numbness, but I urge you to imagine their names, faces, and the horrendous violence they endure.  I ask you to do this, because I want to provoke you to action.

I’m asking you to [give.](https://app.etapestry.com/onlineforms/REST/donateform.html)

I know many of you already have already given. I’m asking you to [give again.](https://app.etapestry.com/onlineforms/REST/donateform.html) I’m asking you to share in, to bear, a small fraction of the pain our clients experience for two reasons:

<b>Give for your sake.</b> By occasionally inviting painful sacrifice into our lives, we assault our self-absorption, our bloated sense of independence and our relentless consumerism.

Americans will spend 465 billion this Christmas on gifts this year (1); the majority of dollars spent will make no lasting difference in the lives of those we give to, but instead will offer only a temporary and illusive satisfaction. Even St. Nicholas, the predecessor of Santa Clause, knew this to be true. As the story goes, Nicholas was born to a wealthy family in modern-day Turkey. After his parents died, he inherited a large sum of money. He kept none of it. Instead, he threw bags of gold through the windows of three girls about to be forced into lives of prostitution.  Christmas is about self-sacrifice.

It was for St. Nick, and it was for Jesus.

<b>Give for their sake.</b> Exploitation is the opposite of generosity; it’s theft. Human trafficking generates an estimated $9.5 billion dollars per year globally.(2)  It’s theft on a global scale. Several years ago, thieves ransacked a Salvation Army’s warehouse and stole over 2,000 pounds of food ready to be distributed to some of the poorest people in our region.  Members of the community were so outraged they committed to replace everything stolen. Within two weeks of the break-in, more than 11 tons – 21,500 pounds, 10 times the amount of food lost – had been donated back.  The community’s action not only restored what was lost, but declared to the would-be recipients, “You matter. You’re not alone. Thieves will not have the last word about how our community operates.”  Powerful.

We also have a restorative aim, and we need your help. Currently, our region needs immediate, emergency housing for those seeking to leave the life of prostitution behind. We hear this again and again from other service providers, from police agencies, and from our clients who want to leave but have no place to go.  REST has been in the planning stages of opening a 24-hour Emergency Receiving Center, but we need an extraordinary act of sacrificial generosity to make it possible. Would you help us raise the remaining $25,000 we need for this coming year to open our doors?

""Giving is a miracle that can transform the heaviest of hearts. Two people, who moments before lived in separate worlds of private concerns, suddenly meet each other over a simple act of sharing. The world expands, a moment of goodness is created, and something new comes into being where before there was nothing. . . . But true giving is not an economic exchange; it is a generative act. It does not subtract from what we have; it multiples the effect we can have in the world.” -Kent Nerburn, *Simple Truths*

where-is-god-when-im-suffering,131,Where is God When I’m Suffering?,bridget,2014-11-24,"Growing up, despair felt like my closest companion. Most days, I felt invisible and unknown. My dad struggled through deep depression and bouts of mania, suicide attempts and hospitalizations, and the consequent guilt and shame. Several times throughout my childhood my siblings and I awoke to hearing violent struggles, or my dad urging us to put shoes on so he could drop us off at an orphanage. My mom had left when I was three and, until years later when my dad was found dead on the bathroom floor at a Chicago university, didn’t look back. The despair of believing I didn’t matter to anyone, because I didn’t even matter to my parents, was suffocating.

Though I’ve talked to God as far back as I can remember, even he felt distant or uninterested in delivering me. It seemed that everywhere I looked, I heard the message that I was insignificant and alone.

Disappointed desires and great anguish - sorrow, despair, hopelessness, powerlessness, loneliness, or desperation - can leave you thinking, like it did me, God has abandoned you. You may know he’s real, but wonder if he really cares, or if he’s powerful enough to intervene on your behalf. You may believe that you’re not worth his time and attention or, worse that he doesn’t exist at all.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Walking_on_the_track.jpg)

I understand these feelings all too well, but I want you to know that, when your world is closing in on you and despair is gaining the upper-hand, there is help and hope. Pain is a consequence of the world’s brokenness, but it also alerts us to the fact that something is very wrong. It causes us to understand, like nothing else can, that we are insufficient on our own and in great need of rescue.

God welcomed my wrestling and was honest with me about what I faced. Instead of giving me the temporary relief I sought, he gave me hope that superseded my circumstances. He said, “You will have suffering in this world, but you will never be alone.”

In the midst of my suffering, God comforted me with these truths. I pray he will comfort you with them as well.

<b>1. He sees you.</b> None of your tears have ever been hidden from him. No hurtful word said or act done against you has ever gone unnoticed. No abuse has ever occurred that he didn’t see and grieve over with you. God promises to remember his children always and use for their good what was intended for their harm. “Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.” (Hebrews 4:13) ""Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands…” (Isaiah 49:16)

<b>2. He knows you.</b> He is not a distant creator. God’s story tells us that he knows your name and everything about you. Nothing - no flaws, fears, thoughts, or needs - are hidden from him, and he calls your name regardless of them. He knows your greatest needs, including your need to know that you matter. “O Lord, you have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts…and are acquainted with all my ways…you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb…my frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret…your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me…” (Psalm 139)

<b>3. He has compassion for you.</b> Jesus’ ministry was an outpouring of love, flowing out of his compassion for those in need. Throughout history, God’s compassion has been revealed through his acts of kindness toward humankind, the greatest of which was his sacrifice on the cross. Even in our sin, he has cared for us. He cares for you. “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.” (2 Corinthians 1:3-4)

<b>4. He came for you.</b> Jesus left his throne in heaven and came into the world, because he loves you and offers rescue. It’s why we celebrate Christmas. Jesus came to comfort the brokenhearted, to heal wounds, to bring good news to the poor, and to proclaim freedom for captives. He came into the world to seek and save the lost and sacrifice himself, so that you would no longer be separated from God the Father, but, through his death, be brought near. He came to make you a son or daughter: accepted, welcomed and loved. “But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 8:5)

<b>5. He is near.</b> While you may not always understand why you’ve suffered, you can take great comfort that God will draw near and show himself faithful to you. God’s consistent refrain is, “I will be with you,” so, even in the midst of difficult situations, you are not alone. He promises that, if you draw near to him, he will draw near to you. “Neither…height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:39)

<b>6. He is acquainted with your grief.</b> Just as we experience sorrow in our lives and have our “nights of weeping,” so did Jesus. He experienced tears of sorrow beyond what anyone else has faced. Jesus collects our tears in a bottle and knows intimately what it feels like to be betrayed, overlooked, misunderstood and abandoned. He has compassion and mercy for you when you are suffering. “For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.” (Hebrews 4:15)

<b>7. He advocates both justice and mercy for you.</b> Justice is a term that means, “What is right” or “as it should be.” Justice is one of God’s attributes and flows out of His holiness, which means his judgments are impartial and just. He is not corrupt and does not play favorites. Because all people have fallen short of God’s holy standards, a penalty is justified. But God who is rich in mercy gives everyone an opportunity to receive Jesus’ death as our substitutionary penalty – not because we deserve it, or have done enough to earn it, but as a gift of mercy because he loves us. “There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood…he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.” (Romans 3:22-26)

<b>8. He is making all things new.</b> God will return to the earth to cleanse it of sickness and suffering. God will replace our present suffering with glory. “He [God] will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)",blog
5-incredible-years-whats-next,129,5 Incredible Years: What’s Next,bridget,2014-11-14,"Five years ago, God gave our founders dreams of building relationships with girls and young women who were trafficked for commercial sex. Our hope was to build trust, so they would feel safe enough to identify the things they needed to begin a life free from sexual exploitation.

We not only wanted to build trust; we wanted to maintain it. We knew offering help, then not delivering, would reiterate the message exploited individuals have likely heard before: “It’s hopeless. No one can help you.” So, we made promises carefully, and internally, committed to doing whatever it took to help these women access the resources they needed, including resolving to build them if they didn't exist already.

This survivor-led relationship and needs-based model has driven all of our progress to this point and continues to guide us. This approach has allowed a growing number of women to completely escape and begin to recover from sexual exploitation in our region. In fact, not long ago, REST celebrated helping our 50th young woman completely leave the life of commercial sexual exploitation. And, over the years, we’ve been blessed to meet and offer support to over 1,000 girls and young women, many of whom have taken significant steps toward an exploitation-free future. Each of them have a name, a story, and unique needs, goals, and dreams. We value every single one.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Girl_1.png)

In just five years, REST has gone from a hopeful startup to an organization known for providing competent and crucial services to the most vulnerable in our community. Because of the incredible bravery of our clients to trust, and the community support of volunteers, donors and area partners, our dreams for the future have grown as well. We dream of a future in which our work is no longer necessary, because girls and young women are no longer being exploited. Until then, there is more work to be done.

REST currently operates the only long-term residential program dedicated to adult victims of sex trafficking in our region. We opened it two years ago because young women identified this as a significant resource gap that prevented their escape.

Over the years, both service providers and clients have identified another crucial gap - immediate, short-term housing. After more than a year of dreaming and planning, REST will soon be opening a 24/7 Emergency Receiving Center (ERC). This trauma-informed center will provide immediate intervention and allow victims of sex trafficking 30-60 days of shelter and supportive case management. Our hope is that the ERC will act as a stabilization center for those interested in moving toward long-term housing programs, and provide law enforcement with access to immediate safe housing for young women picked up for prostitution. Some clients will also be eligible to apply for the REST House.

We know we’ve been entrusted with much. It’s rare to be invited into deep places of suffering and vulnerability. We consider this both a great privilege and responsibility.

As we look toward the future, we pause to remember what motivated our work when we first began: Jesus’ words in Matthew 11:28. “Come to me, all who are weary, and I will give you rest.” We know the powerful rest God offers each of us, as both sinners and sufferers. This is our motivation. Because of Jesus’ work on the cross on our behalf, we want to share his Good News to those who need it most. Simply stated, God has been gracious to us – he has loved us, served us, and provided us hope, healing, peace, and dignity – and we are compelled to offer that same grace to those around us.

We aren’t “saviors” or “heroes” in anyway, but we are grateful for the opportunity to lay our lives down in service to victims exploited in the sex trade.

For those who have already joined us, thank you for an incredible five years.

what-happens-when-500-people-come-together-and-giverest,127,What Happens When "500" People Come Together and #GiveREST,bridget,2014-11-09,"We’ve always known that you who partner with REST are some of the most hard-working and compassionate people around. And that you’re motivated to use your talents and resources to change our world for the better. We’re grateful you see love for your community as a long-term commitment and that you think about impacting the world now and for generations to come. We do, too. In fact, because of these commonalities, we’ve already accomplished so much together. Your commitment to care for the sexually exploited in our community has allowed REST to flourish, which has allowed our clients, like Sophia, to flourish as well.

Our team and clients are still buzzing about how five hundred people came together and, in just a few hours, raised two hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Incredible.

As we’ve tallied the totals, we have not seen merely dollars, but the crucial services these dollars will provide: short and long-term housing for girls and young women who would have prostituted for hotel rooms or slept on the streets; access to case management and mentorship, both of which provide the support needed to take steps away from exploiters; counseling, life skills, and education, which are the building blocks for a sustainable life outside the sex trade; and so many other services we couldn’t provide without your generosity. This is the rest you gave. And it is significant for Sophia and the hundreds more like her in our community.

![](http://iwantrest.com/uploads/Posterboard.jpg)

We know that you have many financial obligations and that your dollars must work extremely hard, which makes your generosity at *A Night of REST* inspirational and a privilege to steward. We want you to know that we take the same approach, putting your dollars to hard work in our community. In fact, many of you may not know that last year REST was the recipient of Seattle Met’s “Most with the Least” award, which recognized us as Seattle’s most efficient nonprofit. We are proud of that recognition and are committed to continue operating this way.

REST is dedicated to creating pathways to freedom, safety and hope for girls and young women exploited for commercial sex. We work to expand opportunities for our clients, so they can dream again about their future. You have made it possible to offer relationships and resources that help them envision a life free from violence and increase their access to health services and education. Thank you for allowing this necessary and difficult work to continue.

We’ve heard from many of you that you’d like to stay in touch. As we mentioned this weekend, we’ve spent months searching for, designing, and building our new office headquarters; we will be opening soon, and we can’t wait to invite you to our open house! If you are interested in attending, please be sure to sign up for our REST newsletter. There you will also be able to find information regarding our next [REST Training Day.](http://iwantrest.com/events/detail/training-day) We promise not to overwhelm you with communication, but to keep you apprised of how your partnership is making an impact.

Again, thank you for joining us for *A Night of REST*! We look forward to a future where girls and young women are no longer sold like commodities, but honored and loved as image bearers of our God.

With much respect and sincere gratitude,

buyer-beware-campaign-moves-the-state,125,Buyer Beware Campaign Moves the State One Step Closer to Being Inhospitable to Traffickers,admin,2014-10-20,"In 2011, sex buyers tipped their hands and disclosed what they believed would dissuade them from using women involved in prostitution. In the comprehensive study, [Comparing Sex Buyers with Men Who Don’t Buy Sex](http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/pdfs/Farleyetal2011ComparingSexBuyers.pdf) Melissa Farley, PHD, Founding Director of Prostitution Research and Education, and Peter Qualliotine, co-founder of the [Organization for Prostitution Survivors](http://seattleops.org/) (OPS), interviewed over 100 sex buyers in hopes of discovering, among other things, any deterrents that would be effective. In it, the men identified considerably small penalties; 89% said they would be deterred if their name were added to a sex offender registry, 90% said they would be deterred if a $1,000-$2,000 penalty were imposed, and 100% of sex buyers said they would be deterred if sentenced to a one-month jail term.

Thanks to a historic coalition between law enforcement and community advocates throughout King County, the estimated 27,000 King County men soliciting sex online every day may get to test their own theories. This week, the prosecutor’s office unveiled a new pilot program, Buyer Beware, which aims to reduce local demand for prostitution by 20% in the next two years. The campaign is part of a national strategy, Cities Empowered Against Sexual Exploitation (CEASE), that seeks to hold men accountable for fueling the demand side of the sex trade. Currently, ten US cities are participating with similar initiatives, including Boston, Denver, Chicago and Portland.

Buyer Beware includes expanded training for undercover sting operations, a commitment to increased arrests and prosecution of buyers, more publicity of those arrests and convictions, and the utilization of pop-up ads on the Internet, in places such as Backpage, where buyers are trolling sex ads. The hope is to educate men about the harm they are causing, and warn them of potential consequences. The initiative also commits to redirecting imposed fines to support victim services. [REST](http://iwantrest.com/team) has been privileged to participate in a coordinated effort with a number of agencies by providing support and services to the girls and young women recovered in sting operations.

“Historically, women and girls involved in prostitution were arrested up to 10 times more often than sex buyers, and were three to four times more likely to face prosecution,” said Val Richey, King County Senior Deputy Prosecutor, who handles most of the office’s prostitution-related felony cases. But now, their office vows to focus on reducing demand by targeting sex buyers rather than victims.

Throughout the county, buyers convicted of patronizing adults for commercial sex may face up to 27 months of jail time, a $5,000 fine, and registration as a sex offender – all conditions sex buyers identified as sufficient deterrents in the study. Additionally, all buyers convicted will be required to complete a 10-week course, similar to a Batterers’ Intervention Program for domestic-violence offenders.

Washington State led the nation with the first anti-trafficking laws and currently boasts the nation’s most comprehensive anti-trafficking laws. We have not exhausted every effort to see Washington State become inhospitable to human trafficking, but initiatives such as Buyer Beware continue to take an aggressive stand against exploitation. Says Seattle Attorney Pete Holmes: “If you come to Seattle, don’t plan on buying sex. If you do, you’ll stay here a lot longer.”",blog
how-celebrity-hacks-reveal-privilege,123,How Celebrity Hacks Reveal Privilege,bridget,2014-09-07,"By now, you’ve likely seen headlines about the hacking of more than one hundred celebrities’ iCloud accounts and the subsequent release of their nude photos and intimate videos. These celebrities, as well as the public, were rightly outraged at the massive breach of privacy, saying things like, “If you looked at those pictures, you’re as guilty as the ones posting them.” Jennifer Lawrence, star of blockbusters like *The Hunger Games* trilogy and *American Hustle*, is one of the victims. Lawrence released a statement calling this “a flagrant violation of privacy” and vowing prosecution. Lena Dunham called the hacker a “sex offender” and tweeted, “Remember, when you look at these pictures, you are violating these women again and again. It’s not okay.”

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/celebrity_hacks.png)

The FBI and Apple have taken the act seriously and promised investigations. Apple also plans to roll out new security features to alleviate the public’s concern about their own privacy. And there’s good reason to worry. One recent study revealed 50 percent of respondents had exchanged intimate photos with a romantic partner, and one-in-ten had an ex threaten them with [“revenge porn.”](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Revenge_porn)

It is easy to see that such images should be off-limits for distribution without expressed permissions. Unfortunately, of the 36 percent of Internet traffic that is pornographic, millions of images and videos, many viewed are of women and children who have been trafficked for commercial sex. These are images of rape and exploitation filmed without consent and distributed for profit by their exploiter.[[1]](http://iwantrest.com/2014/09/08/how-celebrity-hacks-reveal-privilege/#_ftn1) One study on the subject found sex trafficking survivors often described filming porn as a regular part of their lives. In fact, approximately one-third of the victims of prostitution in St. Paul, Minnesota indicated being used in the production of pornography.[[2]](http://iwantrest.com/2014/09/08/how-celebrity-hacks-reveal-privilege/#_ftn2)

While our society condemns the celebrity hacks, we accept, defend, and celebrate porn, normalizing its use; this is even done by some of the same celebrities who came to the defense of their ousted peers. In fact, another study found that 79 percent of men, ages 18-30, view porn at least once a month.[[3]](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/2123093) Numbers like these say we are okay with this type of exploitation.
The celebrity hack is atrocious, and the perpetrator should be charged to the full extent of the law. There should be nothing but outrage about what took place. Unfortunately, victims of human trafficking don’t have the same money, power, and privilege to advocate for their own justice. Celebs have powerful PR teams and prestigious lawyers who will no doubt seek recourse.

One blogger indicated he would not be viewing the hacked material, saying, ""After all, it takes a pretty sick mind to find any sort of pleasure in images clearly not intended for your own eyes.” I couldn’t help but wonder if he views porn. If he does, he is violating his own incensed conscience. Similarly, another blogger wrote, “The way in which we share our bodies must be a choice.”

I could not have said it better myself. And I would add that this should be regardless of privilege, celebrity, or lack thereof.

dear-jim-norton-youre-not-funny,121,"Dear Jim Norton, You’re Not Funny.",bridget,2014-08-17,"Recently, comedian Jim Norton, known for his crude talk and sexist comedy routines, wrote and article in Time called [In Defense of Johns](http://time.com/3087616/defense-johns-legalize-prostitution/), in which he defends his right to pay women for sex acts. As a self-proclaimed expert, Norton writes, “I cannot even fathom a guess as to how much money — let alone time — I’ve spent on paid sex in the past 25 years.” I was interested in learning more from this “expert john,” especially because, in the same article, he confesses, “… the most shameful thing I can admit is this: I’m not really ashamed,” and says other men shouldn’t be either.
While researching, I came across several blog posts defending Norton’s position. His defenders cite Norton’s position, calling it ""consensual sex with adult women,"" despite Norton’s own words to the contrary. Norton says, “When I first began soliciting sex for money, it never occurred to me that some of them are possibly forced into prostitution or have abusive pimps. I must have known it down deep on an intellectual level but hadn’t witnessed anything to confirm it. Until I did.”

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/norton_mic_2.png)

Norton goes on to describe the night it did dawn on him. One night while soliciting sex, a pimp appeared and “bounced [the girl he was soliciting] across the hood of his car, and threw her in a van with a group of girls."" Norton said he was ignorant when “he first began,” but he has admittedly continued to buy sex, calling the money he spent the “equivalent of a Harvard Law School education,” for perhaps more than two decades.

Unfamiliar with Norton, and wanting to learn, I watched one of his more popular comedy shows. Norton took the stage to an enthusiastic audience and flashing lights, then opened with a confession that after sex with his long-time girlfriend, he had to remind himself, “not to hand her cash.”

Although extremely difficult to stomach – his one hour routine included derogatory remarks against African Americans, women, people with disabilities, gays, transgender people, Muslims, and others, all set to the backdrop of men and women bent over in laughter and ending with a standing ovation – I certainly learned a lot from this expert john.

During the show, Norton described himself as a “pervert” who became sexually active in the second grade, engaged in oral sex with other children, used both men and women in acts of prostitution, and preferred acts of violence and dominance. At one point, he remarked, “Yea, a lot of people say it’s rape…no,” he said while shaking his head and joking that, when he finished, he showed the person that the gun was fake. He also shared of a time when, at a family dinner with his girlfriend, he blurted out his desire to have sex with child-celebrity Dakota Fanning (age 13 at the time). These statements are in odd contrast to his article that claiming he feels “extraordinarily loving and close [to prostitutes].”

We don’t have to speculate about his feelings toward pimps and women involved in prostitution. During his routine, he said the uninspired, non-rhyming music of today’s rap industry would be improved if a “prostitute” walked onto the scene and said to her pimp, “You gelling?” And her pimp knocked out her teeth, saying, “Bitch, get back to pussy-selling.” Perhaps to stave off potential feelings of shame, Norton commends his audience for laughing at the “inappropriate one,” and instructs them to “not feel guilty.”

One of the most compelling portions of Norton’s show was his self-awareness - where he admitted that his “greatest insecurity” is sex. That seems to be an understatement. His attempts to convince listeners of his hyper-masculinity include statements like: In order for women to be called sex symbols, they “should have the decency to film [sex acts] and sell it,” like Paris Hilton did, “so the world can judge their worthiness.”

I hope you’ve heard enough to know that Jim Norton is no expert. Instead, he’s a case study of a sex buyer who affirms harmful attitudes and behaviors of some of the men who buy sex. His comedy takes the form of bullying: deliberately harming and humiliating others. He is a sad, hurt, insecure man who uses the stage and his dollars to gain a sense of acceptance and approval. He is not a man who knows [the facts about the harm of prostitution](http://iwantrest.com/2013/09/17/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-women-being-sold-for-sex/) or it’s [legalization](http://iwantrest.com/2013/02/12/5-myths-about-buying-sex1/).

In this context, it makes sense that he feels no shame. He lacks empathy, or his empathy seems to have atrophied in order to serve his greater desire to be worshipped and accepted by others.
What doesn’t make sense is while Norton delivers these demeaning and crushing statements, cameras pan the audience to find men and women, bent over in laughter, clapping and cheering with no sense of reservation or regret. What they may not know is that, not only are they standing in defense of johns, but are standing with racism, persecution, misogyny, and bigotry. Knowing that, are they still laughing?",blog
heroin-is-a-bad-boyfriend,119,Heroin is a Bad Boyfriend,bridget,2014-07-08,"“I had no idea this type of help was available.” These were the words that rang in my ears throughout the night and into the early morning, as I counted the hours for the sun to appear. Asmine*, a forty-two year old woman recovered in a coordinated effort between Seattle Police Department’s Vice Squad and Seattle’s anti-trafficking agencies, agreed to go to detox. She handed me her stash-bag, full of drug paraphernalia, and whispered, “I’m ready this time.” Her eyes were gracious and hopeful. She picked out a room at [REST’s](http://www.iwantrest.com/about/) temporarily opened Emergency Receiving Center, saying she’d never seen a place like it before. “It’s the nicest shelter I’ve ever been at.”

><b>Asmine is homeless and addicted to Heroin.</b>

<br>
Asmine is homeless and addicted to Heroin. She thought she’d be able to make it through the night, because she had last used just an hour before her arrival. She grabbed some Gatorade and a small amount of food, declining a big meal because she knew she’d get sick. She showered and said she already felt much better. She asked to go out for a cigarette. She told me that she knew she was lucky to have been picked up and offered help that night, instead of put in jail. “Coming down while in jail is horrible. My husband is doing it like that now.” We agree that the availability of an open detox bed is a miracle and may save her life, and that her husband getting clean makes it more likely that she'll stay clean as well.

I walked her back to her room, asked her if she needed anything, and showed her the Jolly Ranchers in my hand. She took a few and said, “These will help with the coughing.” Her cough, typical for heroin users, keeps her awake throughout the night. The detox process begins with an incessant tickle in the throat, until mucus buildup in the lungs causes pain so intense it feels like drowning. Coughing helps relieve the drowning sensation some, but eventually leads to the user feeling like her lungs are on fire. Heroin acts like a heavy cough suppressant.

><b>""BUT, [PROSTITUTION] IS THE ONLY JOB I’VE EVER HAD TO SURVIVE.”</b>

<br>
By the time Asmine got up again, her breathing was labored; she was wheezing and out of breath. We went out for another cigarette. “It’s going to be hard,” she says, looking everywhere except toward my face. “I know that I am ready this time. But, [prostitution] is the only job I’ve ever had to survive.” I nodded, “Asmine, when you’re ready, we can help you find alternative ways to support yourself and meet any other goals you want to work on.” Her eyes met mine, and she smiled. Her smile was timid and full of pain. It was heart breaking.

At 9:15 the next morning, I knocked on her door. She didn't respond. I knocked again, loudly called her name, reminded her who I was, and let her know she was safe. She asked me to come in. I told her we’d be calling the detox facility in ten minutes, to do her phone screening, and asked if she was ready. She looked exhausted and scared. “I’m ready,” she said. After ten minutes, I returned, and she invited me in. I asked if she wanted to talk for a bit first. She told me that, when she woke up, she thought the whole night was a dream. She could not believe that “a place like this existed for [her].” She asked lots of questions about the detox process, but her pressing concern seemed to be whether or not the facility would really admit her. I asked her permission to sit next to her on her bed. She grabbed my hand and thanked me for making the call. We finished the screening together. Asmine was patient and forthcoming. I admired her strength.

I let her know it was about a ten-minute drive and that I would stay with her throughout the process if she wanted. While driving, she grew more and more anxious. “There’s nothing that can happen now, right? They will for sure give me a bed?” she asked. I let her know that everything was set and reminded her of what she'd said the night before: “You’re ready.” I asked if she preferred the quiet, or the radio. She said the radio would help, and her favorite station came on. “The 90’s had the best music, don’t you think?” she asked, as TLC’s ""Don’t Go Chasing Waterfalls"" played in the background. She knew every word. I wondered if, and hoped that, the song took her back to a happier time in her life.

Once at the facility, we completed the remaining paperwork. The nurse told Asmine she wouldn’t be able to have her phone, or smoke cigarettes while in detox. Asmine asked if we could go outside to smoke one last time. As we walked outside together, she continued to share parts of her story. She said she was afraid and didn’t know how to handle the ensuing grief. “I know I need to stop, but why do I feel like I’m grieving?,” she asked.

><b>“Well, Asmine, Heroin is a bad boyfriend.”</b>

<br>
“Asmine, have you ever been in a really bad relationship? The kind you knew had to end because it was really unhealthy?,” I asked. With tears rolling down her cheeks, she looked at me and said, “Oh, yeah. Definitely.” “And even though you knew you had to get out of that relationship, there were parts of you that didn’t want to let it go?,"" I paused to make sure she was following. ""And even after it was over, there were times when it felt like it would have been easier to go back than to deal with the pain of leaving?,” I continued. “How do you know all of that?,” she asked. “And even when you started to feel better, he’d call or you’d see something that reminded you of him, and you’d be tempted to think, 'Maybe I could go back and things would be different?,'"" I said slowly. I could tell by her reaction she was hanging on every word. “Well, Asmine, Heroin is a bad boyfriend,” I stated emphatically. She looked at me with a new sense of commitment and said, “Wow, I never thought of it that way, but you’re right.” I repeated it again: “Heroin is a bad boyfriend.”

She said she’d definitely remember my words and it really helped thinking about it in those terms. I asked her what things had helped her stay committed to the bad-boyfriend-breakup in the past. Without pause she said, “I made a list of everything he took from me.” ""What a great strategy!,"" I said. I asked if she could make a list of what heroin had taken from her. She agreed that a list would help and added, “I’m going to tape it to my mirror and reread it everyday.”

It was time to go back into the facility. She grabbed my hand and said, “I’m ready.” We walked through the automatic doors and heard the nurse call her name. She hugged me. I told her I was proud of her and that today was marked as the day she decided to take back what drugs had stolen from her. She squeezed me tighter, and I told her I’d call to check on her. She thanked me again and walked down the hallway with the nurse, looking back at me several times before rounding the corner out of sight.

I only had the privilege of knowing Asmine fourteen hours. When I called the detox facility two days later, she was no longer a patient. I never got to know what specific circumstances led her into a life of prostitution and drugs. I didn’t get to know whether she ever had a pimp or trafficker, but I did know Heroin was, at least in part, acting as her pimp now - forcing her to sell the only thing she felt she had, in hopes of bringing in enough money to make him happy. What I can estimate is that, if Asmine entered prostitution at 18 and worked 5 nights a week, conservatively speaking, she had been sold at least 35,000 times. And many of those times have been violent and traumatizing, only furthering her need to numb the pain with drugs and alcohol.

Washington, like much of the United States, has seen an increase in the use and harmful effects of heroin. For over three decades, Washington’s drug-related death rate has been higher than the national average, and it has been rising at an alarming rate, more than doubling in a ten year period. (1) Another study showed Washington State ranks highest in the nation for total percentage of persons addicted to drugs, 9.36 - 13.34%. Despite those shocking numbers, Washington State has only 22 detox facilities with 171 beds. That’s just not enough. These beds are a matter of life and death for our clients. Their access is crucial to restoring hope and bringing lasting change, because Heroin is not only a bad boyfriend, but also one whose breakup comes with years of pain.

men-who-buy-sex-part-1-sin-is-trafficked-goodness,117,"Men Who Buy Sex, Part 1: Sin is Trafficked Goodness",bridget,2014-06-16,"I sat with a man named Jeffrey who had been arrested on charges of soliciting prostitution. He is one of the tens of thousands of Seattle’s johns. In our first session together, Jeffrey remarked, “Friday afternoons are always the most difficult for me to control myself. I am not sure why, but it usually turns out to be the day I end up with a prostitute or an escort. ” Buyers of sex tend to be addressed at this point through a moral framework, which is largely ineffective from a treatment standpoint because it fails to explore how the johns’ current behaviors serve as a map to help us understand the geography of their past. For example, an often overlooked point about the Somali pirates who are now notorious for terrorizing ships off their coast is that they used to be fishermen until their waters were stolen by foreign fishing vessels (the U.N. estimates almost $300 million dollars worth of seafood is stolen each year from their coastline). We look to the past not to find excuses for reprehensible behavior, but because narrative holds the key to unlocking destructive patterns and implementing all future change.

I asked Jeffrey what Friday afternoons have meant for him historically. “Like in childhood?” Jeffrey asked. I nodded my head in agreement. “Well, my mom would usually leave my older brother and I home alone on the weekends because she needed to work her second job -we were dirt poor. My brother would be stoned out of his mind and I don’t know, I usually just rode my bike around the neighborhood. I remember cruising through my neighborhood trying to find girls that I knew from middle school. I would ride around for hours, even after it got dark, just to see if I could get ‘that look’ from a classmate.” Twenty years later, Jeffrey’s Friday afternoon ritual, unbeknownst to him, was essentially the same. The mountain bike became an SUV and a mother with a second job was now a spouse whose job at a concert venue required her to work weekends.

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/prairie_boy-1024x655.jpg)

At the end of our first session, it was apparent that Jeffrey’s getaway vehicle from the loneliness and anger of a painful childhood had become the very vehicle that was now driving him into a life of crisis. This is often the case with our addictions; the activities and behaviors that help us survive our formative exiles tend to lead us into slavery or relational conflict later in life. The faces he sought out in middle school which brought him a sense of validation and even rest were now costing him over $40,000 a year when we added up all of the expenses associated with buying sex.
The word sex is taken from the Latin word secare meaning to sever, to amputate, or to disconnect from the whole. Sex then is the awareness of how severed we are from one another and the way we go about reconnecting.[1] This perspective echoes back to the language of Genesis 2 where God says, “it is not good for man to be alone.” A few verses later, in one of the most comical portions of Scripture, Adam is watching the entire created world copulate, but “finds no one suitable for him.” The one thing that is not good prior to the entrance of sin is that man is alone. The way Adam’s aloneness is rescued is through the creation and presence of Eve.

It could be said then that the goodness of sex gives us the experience with our beloved of finding ourselves less severed, less amputated and less disconnected from our fragmented world. Sexual sin or perverse sexual behavior on the other hand exists to the degree to which an individual consciously or unconsciously experiences secare but then requires or uses another human being or created thing as the object of their lust and anger. Those who are sexually exploited or trafficked in this scenario experience what it means to be more severed, more amputated, and more disconnected from their humanity and status in the community. The complexity however is that even the one who has sinned is still seeking a form of goodness – to be less stressed, less alone, less burdened, more alive, more in control and more connected to another. The irony of sexual addiction or compulsive sexual behavior is that it is actually against sex and therefore cannot give us the experience of what erotic love is intended to offer.

The biggest biblical idea about sin is that it is an intruder and therefore once in the world, the only way for it to survive is to become a parasite of goodness.[2] Think this over. The intelligence of a pimp or trafficker came from God. The physical power and even the manipulative kindness used by a pimp toward a teenage runaway comes from the gift of good health and the mind to see vulnerability. In every childhood story we read, the villain could not be an evil genius without being a genius. Nothing about sin is created ex nihilo – out of nothing; all its power is trafficked from goodness. “Goodness” says C.S. Lewis, “is, so to speak itself: badness is only spoiled goodness. And there must be something good first before it can be spoiled.”[3]

Evil needs good to be evil. Through this lens, johns or sex buyers would be seen as under the domain of evil, which seeks to traffic their longings for legitimate experiences and convert them into coercive and demeaning desires. The outcome is that johns experience alienation in their shame and guilt for buying sex, which leads them to buy more sex, all the while increasing the excruciating alienation and trauma of the women (and men) whose bodies are purchased. The compounding interest evil earns through sexual harm makes it the most profitable enterprise of all time.[4]

In my work as a pastor and psychotherapist, the razor edge I must walk with people who come into my office is over the slickest terrain on this earth; the place where the origins and motivations of their addictions reveal a goodness so stunning it has taken my breath away and simultaneously where we discover that the harm many of these johns have experienced in childhood was orchestrated by a perverse, yet brilliant conductor who used the goodness and desire of these boys to seemingly implicate them in their own abuse. These dynamics are not easily understood for there is far too much complexity. What I know to be true however is that it takes guilt for men like Jeffrey to understand the failures of their sexual behavior, but it takes dignity for them to discover their goodness, no matter how spoiled. The problem is that our society thirsts far more for stories of failure than it hungers for redemption.

Working with men who buy sex over the years has solidified for me the notion that we do not struggle against flesh and blood, but against the very rulers and powers of this dark world. This in no way excuses the behavior of johns, but it does provide us with a more efficacious framework to engage these men. This framework matters because if we desire to work for a better world, we must learn new ways of addressing and understanding the men who are responsible for so much if its harm. The initial steps we can take towards this end are found in the paradox of sexual sin that I have attempted to underscore – that evil must hijack dignity and beauty in order to be successful. If this is true, the question becomes, will we have eyes to see not only women in prostitution, but also the buyers of sex as the faces of those who are trafficked through the economy of evil?

5-considerations-when-starting-an-anti-trafficking-organization,115,5 Considerations When Starting an Anti-trafficking Organization,bridget,2014-06-03,"On a monthly basis, REST receives inquiries from people all over the country who are considering starting an anti-trafficking organization and are looking for a “how-to.” We are so grateful to be receiving these requests and know first-hand how important it is to learn from others who have gone before you. We did this too. We decided to write this blog, in hopes of providing some things for your group to consider before starting an anti-trafficking organization.
Before I launch in to a set of “how-to” steps, it’s crucial to begin by understanding your motivation. What compels you to do this work?

###MOTIVATION

Ask yourself “why?” Why do you want to do this work? If the answer is something as simple as “because I want to help people,” ask yourself “why?” Why do you want to help people? Your motivation is not only important to the clients you may eventually serve, but remembering the “why” will sustain you through the inevitable long hours, disappointments, failures, and uncertainty.

REST was built on Jesus’ words in Matthew 11:28: “Come to me, all who are weary, and I will give you rest.” We know the powerful rest God offers each of us, as both sinners and sufferers. This is our motivation. Because of Jesus’ work on the cross on our behalf, we want to share his Good News to those who need it most. Simply stated, God has been gracious to us – he has loved, served, and provided hope, healing, peace, and dignity – and we are compelled to love those around us by offering the same. We aren’t “saviors” or “heroes” in anyway, but we are grateful for the opportunity to lay our lives down in service to victims of human trafficking and those exploited in the sex trade.

<b>According to industry experts, more than 100,000 nonprofit groups nationwide will fail within the next two years. With more than a million US charities in existence today, how will you ensure viability? We think these 5 steps will help.</b>

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/5-THINGS-PICTURE.jpg)

###STEP 1: SURVEY THE LANDSCAPE

We believe the first step is to do extensive research and canvass existing services and providers in your area. There are exceptions, but if trafficking victims exist in your community, it’s likely these girls and young women are already in contact with local service providers like police, foster care, domestic violence shelters, hospitals, and schools. Seek to understand the needs of sexually exploited people and learn what they are asking for. Ask existing service providers and, if possible, clients, to identify gaps in services, and allow them to dream with you. Begin to map out the existing services and build a network of support. Here are a few questions to ask:

1. Who is currently serving this population?
2. Are the services effective? How do you measure that?
3. Do those existing services have adequate staff and funding?
4. What resources are needed but difficult to access?
5. In your experience, what do the clients identify as their biggest needs and barriers?
6. What gaps in services do they see?

Meaningful collaboration is a core value at REST; we believe in a thoughtful, effective, strategic continuum of care. REST is committed to engaging a broad spectrum of services aimed at ending exploitation and injustice. We work within a network of people and groups – area social service providers, other faith-based organizations, government departments and agencies, researchers, educational specialists, mental health providers, and anyone else who is providing the services our clients need. We carefully surveyed our local landscape to see what gaps in services existed, and have remained committed to finding or building the services to fill those gaps.

###STEP 2: SOBER SELF-ASSESSMENT

It’s a good assumption that, after a thorough survey of the local landscape, you will find gaps, whether within direct services, training and awareness, staffing, funding, or something else. After you’ve identified the existing gaps, it’s time to take a sober self-assessment.

When considering taking on any role, an assessment of skills is necessary. In anti-trafficking work, not doing so can have devastating consequences. <b>Offering help, and then not delivering, can reiterate the message exploited individuals have likely heard before: “It’s hopeless. No one can help you.”</b> Many victims of human trafficking suffer the effects of complex trauma, co-occurring disorders, addiction, complex family histories, and financial and social barriers. If you plan to serve them, assess whether or not you and the individuals in your program have the skills, training and resources to actually follow through with what is actually needed. Here are a few questions to consider:

1. Have you worked with vulnerable populations before? How did it go?
2. What training and skills do you possess? What training or skills does your team possess? What is missing?
3. Where can you gain more experience and training? (Internships, volunteering, free or low-cost domestic violence training or safety planning, etc.)

REST began with people that had experience in social services, providing sexual assault counseling, engaging in late-night outreach to sexually exploited young women, training in wrap-around case management, and more. That was the beginning; as we developed, we made a long list of competencies we lacked and sought team members who could step in with those strengths. We still do this today, and it is a big reason we’re able to serve hundreds of clients each year.

###STEP 3: INCLUDE SURVIVOR VOICES

When we make assumptions about what people need, including the girls and young women trafficked for commercial sex, we not only waste time and resources “helping” an imaginary person, but we further exploit those we seek to help. By definition, pimps and traffickers have removed their victims’ agency. They have silenced their voices through manipulation, fraud, or coercion. As service providers, we must keep this in the forefront of our mind and mission at all times. <b>Incorporating the survivor voice and leadership at all levels is crucial.</b>

Since REST began, our primary aim has been to build relationships with girls and young women being trafficked for commercial sex. Our hope was to build trust, so they would feel free to identify the things they needed to begin a life free from sexual exploitation when they were ready. Once their needs were identified, we were committed to doing whatever it took to help them access resources; including building those that did not yet exist. This survivor-led relationship and needs-based model has driven all of our progress to this point and continues to guide us. This approach has allowed a growing number of women to completely escape and begin to recover from sexual exploitation in our region.

###STEP 4: BUILD TRUST & SUPPLY EXCELLENT PROGRAMS & SERVICES

Most traffickers and exploiters recognize a young woman’s vulnerabilities and gain access to them through affection, compassion, and a promise to help. He or she becomes a companion who listens and promises protection and a better future. Then, they make an offer—if she leaves, he or she take care of her. <b>This relationship closely parallels what service providers’ offer, which should cause us to proceed with caution and patience.</b> If a young woman risks leaving what’s familiar and the person who seemed to show loyalty and care, perhaps for the first time in her life, as a service provider, you’d better be ready to respond with relational integrity, and superior services. Here are some questions to ask:

1.How are survivors informing your programs? What are survivors asking for? How are clients able to provide regular feedback about your services?
2. How will you assess the effectiveness of your programs? What measurable outcomes do you plan to achieve?
3. How much funding will you need?
4. Where will the funding come from? How do those sources affect your programs and services?
5. Who should be on your board of directors? What competencies should they have?

REST started by doing weekly outreach with a team of dedicated, trained volunteers. As we learned from our clients and service providers about gaps in services, we built programs at a pace that felt rapid at times, but that we felt God was asking of us and we could sustain. We secured the staffing and funding necessary to provide stable and quality programs. Now, after almost five years, we have six and a half paid staff members, nearly 80 volunteers, and eleven programs, including those direct outreach services we began with.

###STEP 5: BE THERE FOR THE LONG HAUL

We’ve heard the staggering statics - the problem of human trafficking is immense and systemic. The numbers can be daunting, whether you are looking locally, regionally, nationally, or globally. Given the complexity of recurring issues, helping someone recover from years, or possibly a lifetime, of sexual abuse, assault and exploitation will require patience, creativity, and endurance. In addition to building excellent services and programs, you need to be committed for the long haul. One of the inadvertent consequences of a well-meaning organization closing up shop is the reiteration of the message that help is not available. For example, when an organization in an impoverished area runs out of funding and is no longer able to offer educational support, this failure breaks down trust in other existing or future organizations that promise help. <b>Statistics show that, on average, it takes seven attempts to successfully exit “the life.” Are you committed to being there for attempt number 4 or 7? Are your funders?</b> Some questions to ask:

1. What benchmarks for success will inspire you to continue?
2. What does your ten-year plan include?
3. Who will be your successor?
4. What partnerships do you need to ensure you are there for the long haul?
5. While REST hasn’t been around long enough to share stories about longevity, we do ask ourselves these same questions. This week, we are in the process of relocating our office space. Client needs, future plans and sustainability are at the top of our list of considerations.

We’ve spoken to enough people over the last few years to know that these considerations can be daunting. But we can assure you that these will be some of the most critical hours spent in evaluating whether you should start an anti-trafficking organization; they will pay off a hundred-fold in the long run and show that you are motivated to do whatever it takes to ensure that commercially sexually exploited girls and young women are cared for and not subjected to another empty promise.

counting-the-cost-of-justice,113,Counting the Cost of Justice,bridget,2014-05-28,"I imagine most of you who attended REST’s Sex Trafficking & the Gospel event this past weekend are still considering the powerful teachings presented. I am, too. In fact, I’ve spent the weekend pondering the sharp, yet truthful words shared by Reverend Eugene Cho, “We love justice until there’s a cost.”

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/Counting-the-Cost-of-Justice.jpg)

Jesus’ words in the book of Luke come to mind, “For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost?” In this passage, Jesus is talking about the cost of following him as a disciple. He tells his followers the cost would be great. This great cost would be nothing less than death to self. Following Jesus requires him putting to death your old nature, along with its sinful desires and passions. To love what Jesus loves requires further cost. Jesus instructs his disciple Peter that loving him means loving his people. Upon hearing these words, no doubt Peter had Jesus’ gruesome and unjust death on the cross, which happened just days before, on his mind.

When Jesus counted the cost of redemption, he concluded that the hefty price, death on the cross, was his joy to pay. Because of his sacrifice, we can count our sacrifices as joy and love what He loves, like justice, in the same way. We may lose time, comfort and money, but we receive an inexplicable joy when we follow Christ. We can join the Apostle Paul in saying, “For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain,” because “it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.”

I had the privilege of seeing joyous sacrifice among the nearly 350 attendees of Friday night’s Sex Trafficking & the Gospel event. We want you to know that we consider each of you essential partners in our work. We appreciate your generous giving of time and money. <b>Your generosity helped us raise more than $16,000 and allows REST to continue providing services to the most vulnerable in our city.</b> You make providing pathways to freedom, safety and hope, for victims of sex trafficking and those exploited in the sex trade, possible.

They are forced to endure repeated acts of violent sexual exploitation for the profit of their traffickers and the pleasure of [their buyers](http://iwantrest.com/2013/04/30/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-men-who-buy-sex/). The hearts of men are so full of lust and sexual deviance that they are paying to exploit girls among one of the most the most vulnerable demographics in our culture. The [porn industry](http://iwantrest.com/2013/12/10/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-porn/) continues to promote sexual violence and nurture addictions of objectifying and abusing women. It would seem there is indeed cause to despair or, worse yet, grow apathetic to these evils and chalk it up to “that’s just how the world works.”

We should be grieved. We should weep. We should be freaking out. We should experience righteous, anger. We should explode with compassion and be moved to meaningful action. But, despite the dominant culture’s best efforts to convince us otherwise, we should never, ever despair.

A mentor of mine used to say, “hope is a theological virtue.” The Psalmist cried out in similar fashion: “I lift up my eyes to the mountains – where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth (Ps 121:1).”

At REST, we are in the business of looking to Jesus for help; His promises leave no doubt that He is making all things new, and that victims of sex trafficking and people involved in the sex trade are not beyond the reach of the redemption and restoration that Grace provides. We are in the business of refusing to believe the voice of the dominant culture, people who do not always agree that there is hope for the young women and girls we serve or, even more so, the men who buy and sell them. And while all that we do is motivated by the love of Jesus, we are committed to serving young women of all faiths.

Providing pathways to freedom, safety, and hope for girls and young women victimized by sex trafficking and people involved in the sex trade is a long journey of obedience. There are many joys, victories, and celebrations. There are also gutting setbacks, deep disappointments, and opportunities to stretch and trust God in ways that we would likely rather not. We are a ministry of presence, mercy, and justice; hallmarked by personal sacrifice, authentic relationships, and competent services; and striving for programmatic quality that is world class. We are consistently engaging with the anti-trafficking community to learn, listen, and share best practices.

foster-care-a-pipeline-for-traffickers,109,Foster Care: A Pipeline for Traffickers,bridget,2014-03-07,"Economics teaches that the principle of supply and demand determines the availability of a particular product. If a supply is readily available, prices drop and demand soars. Human trafficking is no exception. According to the FBI, more than 100,000 minors are sold for sex in the U.S. each year. It’s a staggering statistic that leaves many wondering, “Who are these children and how do traffickers and pimps find them?” Unfortunately, our foster care system has become a training ground for victims and supply chain to traffickers. And with a readily available supply of vulnerable children, who cost traffickers almost nothing to sell, for buyers, the low price of purchasing sex has contributed to fueling demand.

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/Untitled-1024x682.jpg)

Foster care is temporary living placement for abused, neglected, and dependent children, who need a safe place to live when parents or relatives cannot take care of them, often due to stress factors like poverty, substance abuse, incarceration, mental illness, and homelessness. In Washington State, approximately 65% of all youth enter the foster system because of neglect, while 35% enter because of physical and sexual abuse.

This early childhood trauma and violence is compounded by the lack of advocate support, repeated foster care placements, and recurring physical and sexual abuse and neglect while in foster care; all of this leaves many of these children starved for a sense of belonging and worth beyond the check that accompanies their placement. Many in foster care normalize the experience of being an object of financial gain by people who are supposed to care. This experience becomes the training ground for youth who don’t see much difference between being “nothing more than a paycheck” to their foster home and bringing money to pimps and traffickers.

Walker Pettigrew, a survivor of child sex trafficking who was born into the foster care system explained, “In most of my 14 different placements in foster-care homes, I was raped and attached to a check. I understood very early that I could be raped, cared for and connected to money. It was therefore easy to go from that to a pimp, and at least the pimp told me that he loved me.” Unfortunately, Pettigrew’s foster care experience is echoed by many of the 10,000+ children across Washington State and 400,000+ children nationally. In fact, statistics only confirm these findings. In 2013, 60% of the child sex trafficking victims recovered in a 70-city FBI raid were children from foster care or group homes.

Another chilling parallel between many children in foster care and those who become victims of traffickers is the transient lifestyle. Because many children in the foster care system are placed in multiple homes, they are desensitized to the dangers of pimps or traffickers moving them from house to house, hotel to hotel, or city to city. This transient lifestyle also can produce attachment disorders, making them more susceptible to bonding with their trafficker. In fact, many of our clients say their most consistent relationship has been with their pimp and his “stable.”

There are 400,000+ children in the foster care system on any given day, and another 20,000 “age out” of foster care each year. Nearly one third of these young adults become homeless within eighteen months, making them vulnerable to traffickers for the same reasons.(2) (3)

Currently, not enough is being done by child welfare systems to properly identify children who are being trafficked or have gone missing, making it far too easy for pimps to prey on this population and use the foster care system as a supply pipeline. Thankfully, last month the US Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Dave Reichert (R-WA), Subcommittee Ranking Member Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) and a bipartisan group of 15 additional Members of Congress introduced a bill to prevent child sex trafficking and keep youth in foster care from becoming victims of this crime. H.R. 4058, “Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act,“ was introduced by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Congressional Subcommittee who oversees the nation’s foster care system. The bill represents a strong bipartisan step forward in protecting youth in foster care.

Reichert said, “We owe it to these children to ensure our nation’s foster care system does all it can to protect them so they can live safe, happy and successful lives. For too many kids in foster care, we are not living up to that promise today. This bill will help us identify child victims of sex trafficking and develop a plan for how to help them. It will also help us get to the root of the problem by cutting some of the red tape that makes youth in foster care so vulnerable to traffickers in the first place.”

It’s the least we can do.

how-traffickers-exploit-people-for-sex,107,How Traffickers Exploit People for Sex,bridget,2014-02-03,"Exploitation has many faces. Human exploitation, at its most simple definition, is an abuse of power for personal gain and/or profitable advantage at the expense of another.


![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/0001rI1.jpeg)

<b>Sex traffickers</b> – those who recruit, transport, or harbor people by [physical or psychological] threat, force, fraud, or coercion, in hopes to profit from their victims’ sex acts – also have many faces, making them difficult to spot and thwart. When it comes to commercial sexual exploitation domestically, here are the three most common:

<b>The Boyfriend Pimp.</b> The Boyfriend Pimp, also known as a Romeo or Finesse Pimp, is a trafficker who masquerades himself as romantically interested in a vulnerable girl or young woman. He will typically commit to a period known as “grooming,” where he buys her gifts, gains her confidence, and isolates her, then exploits her financial, social or emotional dependance upon him. He often begins to “sell the dream” to her with elaborate promises of a better life and fast money and continued future luxuries. Common places he might find girls to prey on are Greyhound bus stations, malls, court houses and outside jails.

One such pimp was quoted as saying,

“I was once asked, “Which one is more powerful, love or hate?” I answered the question this way: I would run into a burning building, risking my life to save someone I loved. But I would not run into a burning building and risk my life to kill someone I hated. My leadership abilities, style, and technique stem from a point of love. I referred to my ladies in private, as well as in public, as my “wives.” A man or woman will do ten times [more] to please and protect someone they love as opposed to someone they feared. So fear was a weapon used only against outside agitators. My homes ran as finely tuned sorority houses.”

<b>The Gorilla Pimp.</b> Gorilla Pimp is the universally accepted term for a pimp who uses constant violence and threat to break down the will of a victim and rope her into total submission. This type of pimp often rapes, beats, and emotionally batters his victims, in effort to destroy her hope.

<b>A Gorilla Pimp’s</b> victim shared one such story in court earlier this year recounting being stripped, choked and waterboarded in a shower stall by her pimp. She said the only thing that saved her life was “a promise to have his name tattooed on her neck that night.”

<b>The Bottom-Girl.</b> Not all pimps and traffickers are men. Many of us have heard the term “madam,” meaning a woman who owns and operates a brothel, but perhaps many of us would be shocked to know that peer girls also recruit other girls and young women into the life of prostitution. In the hierarchy of a pimp’s structure, a “bottom girl” is one who has “proven” to be the most loyal to the pimp or trafficker. She earns this position most often by being badly beaten as an example to other girls within the pimp’s structure so that they remain loyal. She watches the other girls when the pimp is not present to ensure his rules and guidelines are being followed and their loyalty does not waiver. She is indoctrinated to believe law enforcement and many social services are not trustworthy. If her pimp is charged, she will not cooperate in the investigation, thinking her loyalty to him will earn her more respect.

This role often leads to intense trauma-bonding and contributes to her dual role as victim and exploiter. In some cases, these Bottom Girls appear as a new “friend,” luring an unsuspecting but vulnerable girl into the grips of a pimp. Recruitment can happen online, in high school or even while on the bus. One such girl, when asked why she participated in the recruitment of other girls, said she was attracted to it because, “I created my own family, not the bastards I came from,” while another girl responded, “I come from this. It’s a family business. My mom, uncles, sisters and cousins all do this. It’s normal where I come from.”

While there are lots of general characteristics that make some people more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and trafficking, this is certain – recruitment is well-organized, and those we fight against are extremely motivated. One pimp said, “It’s impossible to protect all girls from guys like I was because that’s what we do. We eat, drink and sleep thinking of ways to trick young girls into doing what we want them to do.”

Parents, talk to your teens. Teachers and educators, learn to recognize the signs, and intervene wherever possible. Community members, rally around organizations providing much needed resources to youth. Businesses, provide meaningful opportunities for vulnerable people. Legislators, continue to steepen the penalties for those guilty of exploitation. Exploitation has many faces, but so does hope.",blog
5-things-to-start-in-2014,105,5 Things to Start in 2014,bridget,2013-12-29,"New Year’s celebrations started as a pagan tradition, worshiping Janus (a two-faced god who looks backward into the old year and forward into the new) thought to be the protector of beginnings and endings. During the Roman reign, it was not uncommon to see statues set atop bridge columns where passersby would touch the head for good luck.

After Christ, Christians sought to redeem the new year custom by replacing idol worship with a time of fasting and praying. Famous Puritan theologian Jonathan Edwards took resolution-making to new heights, recording [70 resolutions](http://edwards.yale.edu/archive?path=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZHMueWFsZS5lZHUvY2dpLWJpbi9uZXdwaGlsby9nZXRvYmplY3QucGw/Yy4xNTo3NDoxLndqZW8=) which he reviewed weekly. In contrast to the Romans, Edwards knew his ability to keep such resolutions was dependent upon the grace and will of Christ Jesus.

![](http://stopbuyinggirls.com/uploads/0001xf.jpeg)

In the same vein, this new year brings us an opportunity to, by the grace of God, keep that which he has commanded, such as defending the oppressed. Here are five resolutions to start in 2014:

<b>1. Start Praying.</b> Human trafficking is a problem of evil. It reflects a powerful clash of spiritual forces. Every believer of Jesus Christ should be greatly disturbed when they learn about exploitation of any kind, because it’s the temporal advancement of evil. Traffickers and pimps, johns and madams, porn purveyors and consumers have declared war on God and His creation. They have set their minds to the things of the flesh and – make no mistake – the only outcome is death. They are in desperate need of a new heart and the salvation that comes from Jesus Christ alone.

Because of Christ’s work, our Father hears our petitions and responds to them all in his good and perfect will. Although the problem of sexual exploitation is massive, we do not have to lose heart. God tells us that, “this is the confidence which we have before him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us” (1 John 5:14). We know His will is to set captives free, as declared in His Word, so boldly ask Him to move in the hearts of men and women in our city; ask that exploitation would no longer reign, but that women would be honored as the children of God. Likewise, ask him to heal the broken hearted and lead the oppressed to find rest in Jesus.

<b>2. Start Counting the Cost.</b> I was in junior high when I first heard about Nazi genocide and the mass killing of 11 million people. Although the number was too large for me to appreciate, I remember asking my teacher how Adolf Hitler was able to kill so many people in just a few years. “Why didn’t anyone stop him?” His answer was disillusioning; he said that Hitler was partly able to run rampant for years, because most nations were fatigued from WWI and the cost of going to war felt too high.

It’s not unlike the place many of us stand today. We feel pulled in too many directions, we believe the opposition is too great and we are resigned to the idea that, although trafficking is horrible, engaging in battle is too costly. So, like the millions enslaved in Nazi concentration camps, today millions of people all over the world are enslaved in brothels and hotel rooms, on porn sets and in invisible prisons of poverty and chemical and relational dependence.

Will you count the cost of a world where women and children are bought and sold like commodities? Will you consider the prevalence of violence in porn and its affect on behavior and attitudes towards women? One recent study reports 68% of men view porn weekly and, of the top 50 most popular porn videos, 81% depicted violence against women. These men are doctors, judges, teachers and members of Congress. What will it cost you, your mom, your sister or daughter, when the men in our culture, those who are in positions of power, no longer see the intrinsic value of women, but see them as objects to be used to gratify their sexual urges?

<b>3. Start Serving.</b> If you live in the Seattle-area, join us at our next REST Training Day to learn more about the dynamics of sex trafficking, the sex industry in Seattle; and direct outreach with girls, women, and men. Attending a REST Training Day is the first step to becoming a REST volunteer. We have all sorts of positions, from direct outreach to support services.

If you are on the east coast or interested in international human trafficking and how to begin serving, attend an IJM Conference, Love 146 event, or Shared Hope film screening of Chosen to find abolitionist groups near you.

<b>4. Start Giving.</b> Support local organizations working against sexual exploitation. At REST, an ongoing monthly gift will immediately begin providing vital resources to victims of sex trafficking in our area. Christmas was just a few days ago and a time when we remember that we’ve been given the greatest gift of all, Immanuel, God with us. If we, who have been given everything in Christ, are not generous to those in greatest need, we have forgotten all that we have received in Christ. We have been justified by his grace, made heirs with Christ and have hope of eternal life. Because of the riches with which we have been entrusted, we can devote ourselves to doing good, no longer storing up the things of this world, but laying up our treasures in heaven.

<b>5. Start Talking.</b> Speak up! Sin grows in the dark, but Christians are called to live in the light. Jesus said, “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”

Talk to your friends, church and community members about the evils of sexual exploitation. Invite your friends over to watch a movie on human trafficking and begin a group committed to praying, serving and giving. Write to your political representatives to let them know you support legislation and funding designed to help trafficking victims. Perhaps the easiest way to begin using your voice is to become a social ambassador for REST by following us on Facebook and Twitter and liking, sharing and re-tweeting new stories, so that those in your spheres of influence hear and join our efforts.

Wishing you a joyous 2014! May God grace us with the ability to care well for those who have been commercially sexually exploited.",blog
