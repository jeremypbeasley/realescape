section1_headline: Our goal is simple â€” freedom, safety, and hope to women & girls
  exploited by the sex trade.
section1_body: Each year, we provide direct services to hundreds of people exploited
  by the sex trade in Seattle and the greater King County area. Through our holistic
  continuum of care (prevention, intervention, and aftercare), we serve those who
  are at-risk, actively in, and those taking steps towards exiting a life of sexual
  exploitation. Our desire is to see Washington become hostile to traffickers and
  to work ourselves out of a job.
